## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- The soul is what ultimately matters.
- Suffering and trauma in childhood can create a drive toward seeking answers and spiritual growth.
- The gay "movement" is a **CIA** program incepted by **4D STS** designed to set up antipathy, differences, and to identify individuals for purposes of inflicting further suffering.
- It is implied that individuals capable of soul development need foundations of security followed by early challenges.

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- The agenda of **4D STS** includes long-term manipulation of human health and behavior to prevent awareness and spiritual growth.

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- Recent group feelings of disturbance, depression, and accidents were due to both shifting Earth's **magnetic poles** and intentional attack.
- Environmental changes are being exploited by certain forces.

---

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- **Genetically modified foods** do affect human DNA and are described as "very bad."
- Poor health compromises awareness and spiritual growth.

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- **HAARP** is mentioned as taking a toll and disturbing energy.
- **CIA** influence over cultural movements such as the gay "movement" was noted as part of **4D STS** manipulation.
- Sexuality imprinting can be used to control individuals by targeting imprint vulnerability windows.

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Awareness and application of knowledge are essential to resist harmful energetic influences.
- A partner can act as a **vector** of harmful waves and be a source of danger.
- Individuals are strongly encouraged to remove toxic relationships and environments to avoid being susceptible.

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- The concept of imprinting is explored using examples like **Konrad Lorenz's** ducks and **Sidney Baker's** work on physiology.
- Lorenz's theory of imprinting is used to explain sensitive developmental stages.
- Cultural tendencies toward extended co-sleeping and breastfeeding are critiqued as possibly regressive or counterproductive.
- Reference to monkey models for parenting and sexuality suggests biological analogies are not ideal for soul development.

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- Individuals can act as vectors of wave attacks capable of leading to illness or death.
- **Martha Crow's** death was attributed to wave susceptibility due to lack of awareness and a psychopathic partner acting as a vector.
- There are quite a few such human "vectors" active in the world today.

- Government signal disruptors were actively interfering with the session.

---

## Contact and Alien Interactions

- The gay "movement" is said to be designed by **4D STS** through the CIA to foster division and suffering.

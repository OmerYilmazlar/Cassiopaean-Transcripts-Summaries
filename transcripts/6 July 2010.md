## Session Details

**Date:** July 6, 2010

**Participants:** Laura, Andromeda, PoB, Belibaste, Burma Jones, Psyche, Atriedes, Perceval, Ail√©n

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- Slowing of Earth's rotation is due to the approach of the **companion star** and its tendency to "ground" the system.

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- Methane is a serious contributor to global "warming".
- Oil is leaking from multiple locations on the ocean floor, not just the well in the Gulf of Mexico.
- These leaks are part of the "**opening up**" phenomenon caused by the sliding of Earth's crust layers due to rotational slowdown.
- 58% probability of Yellowstone supervolcano eruption within the next 5 years.
- Global superstorms in the southern hemisphere would be less violent than those in the north but still present.
- In southern regions, ice ages bring less grip, but major effects include drought, floods, and earthquakes.
- Europe will be affected by windborne toxicity from the Gulf; more noticeable in three months.
- Crust openings and oil leaks may continue for 8 years if nothing intervenes.
- Possibility of intervention is hinted but not disclosed.
- A nuclear solution under current cosmic conditions would worsen the situation.

---

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- People living in toxic areas should detox and avoid exposure if possible.
- Knowledge, proper diet, and supplements are vital for protection.
- Physical swelling and pain on the right side linked to "**planetary linkage**".
- Planet's suffering causes sympathetic physical effects in humans.

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- BP and corporate actions are not part of a grand plan but rather natural chaos resulting from psychopathy.

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- **Knowledge protects**.
- Self-care, diet, and awareness are essential to endure planetary changes.
- Individuals must take responsibility for themselves as they wish the planet to be cared for.

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- Reference made to *The Day After Tomorrow* in discussing hypothetical global superstorms.

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- No gigantic methane eruption/tsunami in the Gulf of Mexico is expected.
- Yellowstone eruption has a 58% chance in the next five years.
- Oil leaks may persist for 8 years unless something intervenes.
- Nuclear detonation would worsen the problem under current conditions.
- Year 0 of a new era possibly begins around June or July **2014**.
- Coming changes will resemble childbirth: "**blood, water, pain, but joy when it is over**".
- Not all will survive; survival linked to utilization of knowledge.

## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- **M****** was abducted and is suffering from **PTSD**.
- **B****** is described as a "programmed human" whose condition is "more severe and less amenable to change."

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- Danny saw a "**rip in the sky**," and the response confirms many such occurrences lately.
- **Chemtrails** are used to maintain the illusion of reality—described as a substance in the sky with electromagnetic effects to "hold the illusion in place."

---

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- **Chemtrails** also have a chemical effect on human brains and physiology.

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- The **Amsterdam server** crash was due to an attack through the owner, but not a conscious one.
- A "**cleansing action**" was behind a recent meltdown—beneficial both personally and for the group.
- A group of **agents** had attempted infiltration, takeover, and destruction of the group. Discrediting was described as "impromptu plan b."
- **Terri** is a conscious agent; **JoJo**, **Olga**, and **Vincent** are not.
- **TB** is confirmed to be a conscious agent.
- The group should be closed, but with modifications in participation as previously outlined—specifically pulling back from deep personal involvement.
- The group should no longer interact with or investigate **VB**, but previously posted material about him should not be removed to avoid setting a precedent.

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- The **I Ching** advised against forgiving and forgetting criminals, specifically advising to cease engagement with VB.

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- Publishing with **Virtual Publishing** was deemed "good enough."
- "**Grace**" is expected to sell well ("Great Gracie! Good night Gracie.").

---

## Notable Warnings & Predictions

- Attacks on the group will continue regardless of the server chosen.
- It is advised to choose based on instincts and server support capabilities rather than attack prevention.
- **Noah** is described as "Extremely!!!" important in the present context.

---

## Technology and Artificial Intelligence

- **Server reliability** is a concern due to external attacks via unconscious influence.
- Consideration between servers in **Canada** and **Hong Kong** discussed.

---

## Contact and Alien Interactions

- No direct alien contact discussed, but references to **hyperdimensional manipulation** and sky anomalies imply such interaction.

## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- Sue's essence exists but is "terribly stunted and deformed."
- Her strong false personality overrides the essence.

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- Humanity previously engaged in "**technospirituality**."
- The cosmic vibrations are expected to change back soon.
- Restoration of technospirituality is anticipated.

---

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- The baby is **autistic** due to both genetic and chemical causes.
- Autism severity could be ameliorated but is unlikely due to Sue's personal issues.
- AIWS can stem from retinal disorder or brain chemistry triggers such as serotonin.
- Dietary adjustments over the long term might help AIWS.
- Detoxifying **mercury** can eliminate "brain zaps."
- A couple likely suffers from dietary toxicity in their home environment.
- **Kamut** is okay to eat, especially under current 3D constraints.

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- Sue is not a conscious agent but acts as a "hostess to the tools of the trade."
- She has a physical **implant** and transmits/receives energies.
- The implant enables monitoring of people close to her, especially Bob.
- Bob was not implanted directly due to his strong will.
- Sue's involvement with Bob is due to programming, not genuine emotion.
- Her role is to monitor Bob due to his associations and contacts.
- "**Them**" (Consortium) manipulated Sue's life through time travel and preprogramming.
- **Pat Z*** (mentioned from 1995 sessions) also had an implant used to monitor others.
- The **abduction** of Sue enabled her implant.
- Sue's aversion to UFO/alien topics is due to programmed failsafe to avoid triggering awareness.
- People like Sue cannot acknowledge reality and are designed not to.

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Group performed well in resisting external psychic interference from Sue's visit.
- Group sickness and mechanical failures were due to **EM bursts**.
- People like Sue attract otherworldly or demonic entities.
- Sue's programming aims to separate Bob from the group.
- Bob must request help himself; unsolicited help is not recommended.
- Publishing the session is acceptable (with changed names), though delay is advised.

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- Earlier civilizations did not practice agriculture as we know it.
- Cereal-based diets have negatively influenced humanity.
- **Techno-spiritual** capability allowed for materializing one's own food in earlier times.
- Future vibrations may allow for materialization of healthy food again.

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- **2012** is "much ado" and not to be worried about.
- If Sue's psychic influence had been stronger, more serious phenomena could have occurred.
- A dream about a plane crash was linked both to Sue's visit and a real-world **IRS crash**—an example of signal response multiplicity.

---

## Technology and Artificial Intelligence

- **EM bursts** possibly caused camera damage.
- Camera can be repaired.
- Hint given that Ark is being helped by Cs with his time machine theories.

---

## Contact and Alien Interactions

- Sue was abducted to install her **implant**.
- Her resistance to alien topics is part of failsafe programming.
- **Pat Z***'s case shows similar monitoring through implants.

---

## Spiritual Practices & Ritual

- Cats purr via self-stimulation of their vagus nerve, similar to **Eiriu Eolas** practice.

---

## Genetics and Ancestry

- **Autism** in the baby has both genetic and chemical origins.
- **Psychopathy** rates provided: 6.5% globally; 1.7% are female within that percentage.
- In the 18th century Lowlands, psychopathy reached 9%.

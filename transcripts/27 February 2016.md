## Session Details

**Date:** February 27, 2016

**Participants:** Laura, Andromeda, Galatea, Pierre, Joe, Chu, Data, Arky, Possibility of Being, Scottie, Niall, Noko the Wonderdog

## Afterlife & Soul Topics

    - Laura: 32
    - Arielle: 26
    - Andromeda: 30
    - Joe: 28
    - Average person: 17
    - The term "strands" refers to more than just physical DNA.

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- "Center of a sphere is a window!"
- The planet and ionosphere act as a **spherical capacitor** that replenishes electrical charge via a portal connection.
- Planetary energies also influenced by the Sun's interaction with its companion.
- The **Wave** is partly emerging from within the planet itself.

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- **El Niño** is powered by the Sun's interaction with its companion.
- The sudden temperature drop (like that which froze mammoths) may have been caused by a **Super Derecho**—jet stream deviation toward the Earth's surface.
- Energy affecting El Niño may come through a portal in Earth acting as a dimensional window.
- "Portal too!"—center of Earth is both a window and a portal.
- The Wave is already showing signs and symptoms.

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- Effects of **iodine**:
    - Joe advised to resume iodine intake cautiously—one drop every other day, possibly applied to skin.
- Heavy metal toxicity findings:
    - **Nickel** from car exhaust and industrial chemicals, not cooking pots.
    - **Cadmium** and **cesium** from smoking are easily detoxed.
    - **Arsenic**:
        - Timótheos: job-related.
        - Andromeda: from products used, including whitener in feminine products.
- **Cilantro** tincture: supportive for natural detox, but insufficient alone for deep detox; mechanical methods like **DMSA** recommended.
- Cold showers for sneezing: beneficial, but a dip in the pool is suggested.

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- Syrian ceasefire: **USA** will encourage covert violations and blame Russia.
- **Russia** doesn't need to threaten Turkey with tactical nukes—the threat is implied.
- USA desperation evident in statements like Kerry's "Plan B".
- **World War III** predictions (per Edgar Cayce) pointing toward Middle East still plausible, but may be interrupted by world events like comets or weather.

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- **Galatea's** dream of flying into outer space: also linked to the effects of iodine on consciousness.
- Galatea's seeing flashes of light in the dark: attributed to phosphenes in the brain.
- **EM "recording"** phenomena experienced at the Farm, likely due to flowing water under the location.

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- "**Black-eyed children**" story: identified as a hoax.
    - Two Asian-looking men witnessed: part of the "away team".

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- Many similar occurrences to **Dyatlov Pass** exist on Earth due to transdimensional transfers and time dilation.
- Portal activity:
    - Dyatlov Pass: involved accidental portal by amateur plant-based beings.
    - Tents were cut after a return via portal.
    - Injuries and missing tongue: results of improper transfer and specimen collection.
    - **Potassium-40** and physiological oddities: "transfer process leak" and failure.
    - Fireballs observed: probing portals.
- Incompetent science in our reality can have similar destructive effects in others, including nuclear experiments.

---

## Contact and Alien Interactions

- **Dyatlov Pass** incident involved a scouting expedition by other-dimensional, plant-based amateur beings.
    - Not intending long-term interaction with humans.
    - Appearance: similar to so-called gray aliens.
    - Goal: mineral scouting; portal opened due to underground mineral content.
- Portals and light balls in the sky can be signs of probing from other dimensions.

---

## Technology and Artificial Intelligence

- Mishandled advanced tech (like portals) can result in phenomena like time dilation, bodily injury, or death.
- Analogy to **Philadelphia Experiment** used to explain remolecularization failure.

---

## Environmental & Industrial Events

- Most dangerous toxins enter human bodies from:
    - Car exhaust
    - Cleaning products
    - Industrial chemicals
    - Agricultural runoff (e.g. from farmers' fields)
- **Arsenic** found in everyday products, especially some feminine hygiene items.

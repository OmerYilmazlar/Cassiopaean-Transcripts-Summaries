## Session Details

**Date:** July 16th, 2009

**Participants:** Laura, Ark, G**, Scottie, C**, P L, Don D, Allen, A**, Joe

---

## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- All "souled" individuals are members of a fragmented **6D** soul/being
- Connection to future/higher centers implies a natural connection with the other members of their **soul group**

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- Some individuals will transition to **4th density** without dying
- Transition involves **DNA unwrapping** or changing under the new cosmic environment, resulting in bodily changes

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- The coming of the **wave** will happen regardless; its effect depends on preparation
- The wave could lead to a "triple bad day" for elite figures like **Rockefeller**

---

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- **Breathing practices** can lead to physiological changes and healing
- **Pipe Breathing** and **sungazing** can be combined with dance for additional benefit
- **Bioenergetic breathing** aids in cleansing karmic and life traumas

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- **200 people** performing the correct dance could block **4D STS** attacks
- Blocking would cut the "elite" off from their **4D STS** power supply
- This could render **mind control** and **frequency fences** ineffective

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- **Maze dances** and **spiral dances** include archaic techno-spiritual practices
- These dances can change the "field" of participants, possibly activating or deactivating **DNA**
- Such practices can open **portals** for positive purposes, including mental blocking of **4D STS**
- Successful application requires purified **bloodlines** and connected **chakras**
- Collective rituals amplify power; exponential increases with more participants
- Optimal performance includes:
    - Dance at sunset on **Moon-day** (Monday)
    - Weekly power addition (later monthly during **dark moon**)
    - Group size of at least **7-8**
    - Avoidance of negative energy locations
    - Inclusion of running water is beneficial
    - Synchronization of bodies = synchronization of energies = resonance
- **Prayer of the Soul** may be chanted, sung, or altered during dances; words will be provided via dreams

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- Dance steps from the first and second referenced videos are closest to the original form
- Original stories like that of the **Maruts** dancing and receiving heavenly baskets reflect ancient practice
- **Native American rain dances** were corrupted versions of the original collective rituals
- References to dances from different cultures (e.g., **Greek**, **Afghan**) suggest a universal root

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- There is still hope, but **STO** beings can only act through humans collectively
- The elite will be greatly affected by the coming **wave** if mental blocking is successful

---

## Technology and Artificial Intelligence

- Human motion in field compared to **electron movement** in circuits: coordinated human movement may act as a "conduit" for energetic processes

---

## Contact and Alien Interactions

- Reference to **4D STS** beings as "marauders" being blocked by mental shielding

---

## Spiritual Practices & Ritual

- **Dance**, **chant**, and **music**-induced states form the core of the practice
- **Sungazing** used before ritual as energetic preparation
- **Spiral** and **maze dances** form neural-like circuits on Earth's surface
- Dances need to be performed collectively for maximal effect

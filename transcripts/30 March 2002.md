## Session Details

**Date:** March 30, 2002

**Participants:** Ark, Laura, BT, VG

## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- True healing occurs at multiple levels as an interaction of prior choice potential.
- Healing is a transaction, often triggered by the healer, but it works because the recipient is ready.
- A full field of awareness closes gaps in consciousness, which otherwise allow viruses to take hold.
- Healing the soul through increased knowledge modifies **DNA** and closes gaps, instead of violating lesson profiles.
- Some souls love light, some love darkness; the choice is fundamental and pre-incarnational.

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- Consciousness "precedes" light as an energy expression.
- Consciousness can create energy; energy does not create consciousness.
- Light is an energy expression of **gravity**, generated through its utilization.
- Consciousness may be an unstable gravity wave or organizing principle.
- Light, when stopped, becomes matter. Consciousness creates light upon interacting with another consciousness.
- Balance is the result of transition to **4th density**, not the prerequisite.
- Frank and Vincent are the other reality—antithesis to Laura's STO-aligned work.

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- BT's leg cramps are due to lactic acid granules and a static lifestyle.
- He should avoid being static; walking breaks the granules loose, causing pain.
- No supplements recommended to assist with lactic acid assimilation.

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- **Reiki** systems such as **Karuna Reiki** are often from "3rd money growing density," not channeled STO sources.
- Many symbols in such systems are recycled from other literature.
- Belief in symbols can make individuals tools of external sources; understanding is critical for a tool to be truly beneficial.
- **Frank** is described as a tool of **4D STS**, having made that choice pre-incarnationally, awakening to his path in late 1998 or early 1999.
- Frank's apparent motivations include illusion of importance, self-aggrandizement, and misperceived validation by others.
- They use lofty terminology to mask their intentions—ranging from religion to ritual magic.
- Conflict with Frank and Vincent reflects broader conflicts, such as that between Jews and Arabs.
- STS mindset is incapable of true group sharing; thus, they cannot accumulate shared energetic benefits like STO groups.

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- **Reiki** symbols function more through geometry than mantras; they act as transducers of higher consciousness.
- Repeating names has no energetic effect; geometry is the essential component.
- Using the **ether tube connector** symbol can send healing energy to the subconscious.
- The efficacy of healing symbols depends on understanding and intent, not blind use or belief.
- One must have precise understanding of a tool for it to truly be a tool, or else become a tool of the tool.

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- **Karuna Reiki** symbols' origins should be researched; users may discover interesting background information.
- Most Karuna symbols are recycled from existing sources.
- **VB** promoted ritual magic (e.g., **Golden Dawn** Satanic rituals), which was in direct opposition to the group's STO path.
- Conflict with **Vincent Bridges** stemmed from his refusal to align with STO work, preferring to push his own occult interpretations.
- The group refused association with such practices, prompting his departure and subsequent attacks.

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- Help is on the way.
- Balance will be achieved in the end.
- Some STS-aligned individuals are "lost in illusion" and serve as tools of **4D STS**.
- Not all individuals will transition to **4D**; STO candidates benefit from shared learning and support.
- STS individuals often return to repeat **3D** due to their energetic inefficiency and lack of group connection.

---

## Spiritual Practices & Ritual

- Blind use of symbols without deep understanding is discouraged; symbols can become controlling rather than empowering.
- Symbols work only if the consciousness gap is closed; otherwise, their effects are limited or misdirected.

---

## Genetics and Ancestry

- **Reiki** symbol application may lead to DNA modifications depending on consciousness and application.
- Healing the soul via knowledge leads to DNA change and closure of consciousness gaps.

---

## Religious and Historical Preservation

- *Mention of misuse of religious or occult traditions to justify STS behavior, but no preservation themes covered.*

---

## Political Power Structures

- Conflicts like that with Frank and Vincent symbolically reflect broader sociopolitical conflicts like the Jewish-Arab struggle.

## Environmental & Industrial Events

## Session Details

**Date:** October 31, 2001

**Participants:** Laura, Ark

---


## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- Cometary bodies and the **Twin Sun** influence planetary movement and pole shifts.
- The Twin Sun "grounds current flow through entire system" initiating a motor-like dynamic.

---


## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- A **pole shift** is possible and highly probable within the next ten years.
- Perpendicularity of Earth's axis to the ecliptic will be restored.
- **Lithospheric shift** will feature to some extent but not dramatically.
- Equator's location will remain mostly stable.
- Geography will change in chaotic ways; mountainous and inland areas will be generally safer due to less folding.
- Trigger events include cometary impacts and forces, and activity from the Twin Sun.
- Planets in the solar system may shift out of orbits due to these influences.
- The magnetic pole reversal is only partly explained by current dynamo theory.
- Missing element in dynamo theory is the **crystalline ammonia core**.
- The coming pole shift will involve a new axial orientation and magnetic reversal.

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- **Orgone energy** helps in curing disease but is not the same energy as used in silicon wands.
- Orgone energy is not necessary to activate DNA previously deactivated by light.

---


## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- Possible but not probable that further terrorist attacks will occur in the United States.
- Not likely for a terrorist attack to occur during that night or the next day.

---


## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Final message: "Love one another."

---


## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- **Orgone energy** is the same as **Odic Force** as described by Baron von Reichenbach.
- Not the same as the energy used in **Giza** or **Stonehenge**.
- Not the same as **Vril** energy or **Kundalini**; the connection to the **Ark of the Covenant**, **Nephilim**, and Sinclair/Oak Island is labeled "nonsense."
- Orgone is not useful for **Unified Field Theory**â€”portal is necessary instead.
- Orgone energy was acknowledged by **Einstein** but did not assist his UFT.
- Orgone energy was not used in the **Philadelphia Experiment** nor for teleportation.
- Some ideas sourced from **Dan Winter**-type theories are referred to as "nonsense."

---


## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- Cometary impacts and celestial mechanics will contribute to these shifts.
- No mini black hole exists at the Earth's core.
- Pole shift with magnetic reversal is highly probable within a decade.
- "Light will break in a big way" is predicted as the next major life event.

---


## Genetics and Ancestry

- **Nephilim** did not intermarry with the Tribe of Benjamin.

---


## Religious and Historical Preservation

- **Ark of the Covenant** not related to Vril force or composed of gold and rutilated quartz.

---


## Historical Insights

- Iron is formed in **supernovae**; Earth's iron content implies solar system origin from supernova material.
- **Crystalline ammonia** naturally accretes iron from supernova remnants.

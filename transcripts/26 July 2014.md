## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- Communication via the board is not advisable for networking across distances during power/tech outages; proper networking through **chakra connection** is needed.
- Enhanced **telepathic ability** will manifest when frequency changes occur.
- Development of "**receivership capability**" comes from awakening conscience and tuning centers as described by Mouravieff.
- The process of awakening involves the opening of the **emotional center** and merging with true conscience.
- It is necessary to release energy into the realm through Work, without attachment to visible outcomes.

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- The "**realm curtain**" was breached due to an electric charge vortex, contributing to aircraft disorientation and crash.
- The vortex created **EM effects** leading to disorientation of the Air Algerie pilots.
- Expect more events like these globally.
- The solar system is "grounding", explaining the sun's quietness despite being at a solar maximum.

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- **Glacial rebound** will occur within months once the tipping point is reached.
- More **vortex phenomena** and electric discharges will occur due to grounding and increased dust in the atmosphere.
- A sinkhole in **Siberia** was caused by internal Earth gas explosions sparked by electrical currents.
- Gas explosions and sinkholes may be triggered by lightning.
- Fires in frozen or boggy areas result from gas released and sparked by electric discharges.

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- **Paleo/keto** diet efficacy is related more to insulin spiking than to total carbs/protein.
- To avoid excessive weight loss on keto diets, consuming more fat is advised.
- **Insulin** causes stress to the body.
- Cold hands and feet are not always due to low thyroid; adrenal fatigue or other causes may contribute.
- Warts are not necessarily a sign of immune weakness; they can be encapsulated by the body.
- **Cryo treatment** is often effective for wart removal.
- Long-term low-dose **doxycycline** (12 months) can help with herpes-related eye issues and may assist with warts.
- Brain chemical adjustments can cause waves of energy and tension during sleep.
- **HeartMath** is "total nonsense," promotes dissociation, and destroys conscience.

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- The **frequency fence** affects more than the US; Canada and Mexico are also affected, with intensity depending on proximity to targeted zones.
- The weakening magnetic field over North America is a result of the frequency fence, not a cause.

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- The **enneagram** system holds about 54% validity; it was essentially "made up".
- Most human psychological systems are similarly fabricated.
- **Cognitive psychology** based on lab and social studies is an exception.
- Awakening conscience is the quality that drives long-term dedication to the Work.
- Staying awake to everything happening is key to maintaining conscience.
- **SOTT** was an act of conscience to combat societal amnesia.
- Proper networking through chakras can enhance group telepathy and action.
- Individuals resonate with truth frequency and can act as "homeopathic medicaments" for the planet.

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- **Pierre's** book is recommended to understand current flow and electrical grounding.
- Most helpful Japanese material has already been transmitted to the West, though much of it is corrupted.

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- More aircraft crashes and disorienting events due to **EM effects** and vortexes are expected globally.
- Sinkholes and gas explosions from Earth's interior due to electric discharge will increase.
- Expect more extreme storms with cyclonic vortex behavior.
- The **glacial rebound** could begin suddenly within months when the tipping point is reached.

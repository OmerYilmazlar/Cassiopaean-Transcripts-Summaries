## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- The **soul** and its helpers can trigger **DNA mutation**
- The **soul** may externally drive mutation if the DNA match isn't ideal
- The soul's helpers include **tribal unit** members both incarnate and discarnate
- **Soul-driven DNA changes** occur post-birth when the soul is seated
- Individuals need to be committed (giving "**all**") to avoid being blocked from programs such as **EE**, as energy imbalance affects **receivership capability**

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- **Black-eyed children** sightings are due to **window fallers** at realm border weaknesses and wave approach
- **UFOs**, **Mothmen**, and similar phenomena increase near realm border fluctuations
- **UFO convention** events are underway, as mentioned in previous sessions

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- **Explosion** heard two days before the session was a **comet fragment** entering the upper atmosphere
- Multiple such atmospheric **explosions** have occurred recently

---

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- **Diet** and "contracting sickness" are methods for **DNA modification** triggered by the soul
- **Cold adaptation** ultimately raises core body temperature by **1–2°C**
- Higher **body temperature** may activate dormant DNA sequences and inhibit viruses adapted to standard **37°C**
- **Cold exposure** paradoxically leads to increased body heat generation
- Constant elevated **body temperature** acts as a natural defense, like a mild, consistent fever

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- **Paul** was not the evil manipulator portrayed by Unterbrink
- Paul was of the **Herodian family** and not from Tarsus, despite legend
- Paul's "pay taxes" message was part of being "wise as a serpent," delivering "**milk**" in letters while reserving "**meat**" for in-person teaching

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- **EE program** is most effective when taught directly, but distribution is acceptable given current restrictions
- Energy must be balanced: those who give little may find themselves blocked
- **Receivership capability** is linked to "mind through central nervous system connection to higher levels"
- The network must expand to reach "full **tribal unit strength**" which will trigger widespread DNA transformation
- **Tribal unit strength** depends on both quality and quantity
- Progression may be individual, but large-scale transformation requires reaching **critical mass**
- "Keep the faith" and daily effort are emphasized as part of the transition preparation

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- **Daniel T. Unterbrink's** *Judas of Nazareth* is referenced; **Judas of Galilee** was the historical "prototype" for Jesus
- The **Slavonic** version of Josephus' **Star of Bethlehem** likely referred to a comet seen in **14 BC**
- Previously dated comet in **25 BC** should be adjusted to **14 BC** to align with Caesar's birth
- The **Testimonium Flavium** insertion in Josephus likely refers to Judas of Galilee's death with name altered to fit Jesus
- **Halley's Comet** timelines require an **11-year** adjustment for accurate correlations

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- "Things will get a lot more interesting" regarding **paranormal events** and border phenomena
- The next period will be especially significant if the network reaches full **tribal strength** and others step up
- Personal **psychomantium** work with pencil and paper is encouraged for future transmissions
- Limitation on personal questions for psychomantium sessions; questions must pertain to broader **destiny paths**

---

## Genetics and Ancestry

- **Introns** are partially connected to tribal unit identifiers: "physiological/spiritual union profile"
- Truncated chemical flows (**neuropeptides**) in DNA were engineered to prevent full genetic activation
- **Orion STS** designers were responsible for truncating genetic code via introns
- Liquid chemical conductors in **DNA** may trigger significant transformations
- Recent studies on viral **DNA phase transition** confirm older C's claims about liquid DNA

---

## Historical Insights

- **Caesar's** story was manipulated posthumously to suppress his teachings and co-opt them into the Jesus myth
- Elements of Caesar's life, including a shared meal before death, were incorporated into the **Jesus narrative**

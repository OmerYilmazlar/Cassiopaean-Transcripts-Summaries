## Session Details

**Date:** May 25th, 2008

**Participants:** Laura, Ark, Andromeda, Joe, S**, Psyche, Scotty, PoB, Patience

## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- People often encounter attached entities during such practices without knowing they were already present.
- An entity that is "invited in" may bypass conscious warning systems and create pleasant sensations.
- Using a **board** creates distance and protection, allowing a person to choose to cease contact with a repellent entity.
- People who throw the board away after a negative experience are likely discarding one of the best tools for identifying and removing the entity.
- The entity doesn't disappear with the board; it returns to "lurking."
- Entities encountered via board-type instruments are often already “in residence” within a person’s space.

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- **Infrared sauna** use recommended: every day for a week, then every other day.
- Chicken deaths linked to exposure to toxic products such as **Veraxyl** and synthetic foams.
- Veraxyl on the chicken ramp was confirmed as harmful and should be removed.

---


## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Using a board-type instrument can help uncover subconscious issues and perform **spirit release therapy**.
- Conscious feedback acts as a warning system during board use.
- **Channeling** without a warning system can be dangerous.
- Most "scary board stories" are fabricated, but real ones relate to uncovering veiled influences.
- Young people should not be involved in board usage due to their natural dissociative tendencies.
- Emotional or energetic phenomena (like falling sounds) linked to symbolic energy releases by female participants.
- Passive observers in sessions can also attract entity attachments; ideally, all attendees should be “clean.”

---


## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- Warning that throwing away the board doesn't remove the entity.
- Young people are particularly vulnerable and should avoid spirit board activities.
- Use caution with synthetic and chemical products around animals.

---


## Technology and Artificial Intelligence

- Computer crashes and lost files associated with dynamic energy bursts among female participants.
- **Mercury retrograde** noted in connection with technological disturbances and symbolic disruptions.

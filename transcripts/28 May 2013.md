## Session Details

**Date:** May 28, 2013

**Participants:** Laura, Ark, Belibaste, Perceval, Andromeda, Kniall, Ailen, PoB, Anart, Athena, Data, mkrnhr, Mr. Scott

---

## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- The "**triple cycle veil** of consciousness bodies" includes psychic/consciousness, genetic, and high soul family.

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- **Transdimensional portals** can manifest as ball lightning and tornadoes.
- Ultra-high energy cosmic rays originate from transdimensional sources, i.e., **dark matter**.

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- "**Sheets of rain**" are connected to electrical phenomena, highly charged cometary bodies, and plasma discharges.
- Sheets of rain, dust, and snow can be electrically conductive and trigger weather phenomena and wildfires.
- Some fires in **UK**, **Ireland**, and **California** were caused by electrical conductivity or unseen overhead cometary fragments.
- **F5 tornadoes** are electrical phenomena akin to ball lightning and related to rising planetary charge.
- **Waco** fertilizer plant explosion caused by a comet fragment with massive electrical charge.
- First fire at Waco plant started by a smaller fragment.
- The "**ice tsunami**" at Mille Lacs Lake was another manifestation of "sheets of rain".

---

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- A mysterious respiratory disease in **Alabama** and **Texas** was linked to secret government experiments.
- Animal deaths were caused by electrical discharges related to increased dust in the atmosphere.

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- Monotheistic religions (e.g., **Judaism**, **Christianity**) derive from the perversion of the **Sons of the Law of One**, under **Orion STS** influence.
- "**Eternal flame**" and symbols like "pillars of light" and "chariots of fire" connect to hyperdimensional control.
- Fake terrorism aims to prevent emergence of charismatic, nonviolent leaders by staging real violence blamed on peaceful groups.
- **Hurricane Erin** was a "portal for the utilized energies" related to 9/11.
- Magnetic field changes during **9/11** were symptoms of the technology used.
- The Waco explosion is described as "information overload" as a wordplay implying both literal and symbolic causes.

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Connecting with others becomes crucial when it's the only way to achieve inner truth.
- Truth within manifests naturally in community, "like pieces of a puzzle snapping into place".
- **Consciousness**, **information**, and **matter** are different concentrations of truth.
- Believing in lies modulates cosmic events negatively.
- Information is stored in consciousness.
- Inner connections—triple cycle veil—can influence cosmic events like lightning strikes.
- Higher electric charge (positive) may correlate with truth; negative charge may relate to lies.
- **Sphere-packing tachyons** and **wormholes** mentioned in context of charge and information.

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- **Judy Wood's** book contains anomalies, but her theories (e.g., **Hutchison Effect**, **Zero Point**) are misleading and serve to destroy information.
- Her behavior also plays a role in discrediting valid observations.
- The "**Third Man Theme**" relates to the Triple Goddess and cometary symbolism, possibly connected to plasma discharges viewed through "sheets of rain".

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- People are attracting their own destruction through belief in lies.
- "**Year without a summer**" predicted with generally colder, unstable climate.
- Population of human/human-looking beings was 835,543,653 at the time; transitions are ongoing.
- **Deja vu** experiences and **EM fluctuations** (ghost sightings) will increase.
- Portents like the magpie with a brain tumor are local warnings; "keep a close eye on local news".

---

## Technology and Artificial Intelligence

- Electromagnetic theories are inadequate as they don't include transdimensionality.

---

## Spiritual Practices & Ritual

- Ancient symbols and rituals involving the triad, triplicative elements, urns, bells, and birds (e.g., **Peleiades** priestesses, laurel and oak trees) may relate to hyperdimensional influences or plasma phenomena ("siren song").

---

## Genetics and Ancestry

- One participant's family situation was the result of an "**interfamily transfer**", not formal adoption.
- Another was sold as a baby by a baby-selling ring; her mother was told the child had died.

---

## Political Power Structures

- Historical commentary on violent vs. nonviolent movements and the strategic assassination of peaceful leaders.
- Emphasis on **PTB** fostering chaos through false flag events and psychological operations.

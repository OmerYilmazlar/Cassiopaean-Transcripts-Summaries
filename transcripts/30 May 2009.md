## Session Details

**Date:** May 30th, 2009

**Participants:** Laura, Ark, G**, Scottie, C**, A**, Joe, A***

---

## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- Dogs euthanized by L*** A*** went to the appropriate **5D** level for pets.
- One day, she will have a dog that will return the favors she gave.
- Keeping animals alive by extraordinary means is a subjective act; human life can serve objectively beneficial purposes for others.
- The act of giving one's life to pets was described as not yielding much return, except for subjective illusion.

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- A "post-cataclysmic" world can refer to a higher density state where ideal nutrients are available.
- Laura's metabolism/genetics are suited to a higher density world.
- Manifestation of nutrients and sustenance may become possible through higher-dimensional accessâ€”referencing the **Maruts** and their baskets from "heaven".
- Possibility of literal energy manifestation or transference from higher realms, akin to the "loaves and fishes".

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- **Swine flu** is expected to make a comeback in winter.
- A drastic population reduction is being planned before climate change progresses too far.

---

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- Toxicity increases susceptibility during pandemics; modern dietary toxicity is allowed and encouraged for this purpose.
- Detoxing the body can lead to abundant health.
- Detoxing the mind and environment leads to abundant life and happiness for all.

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- Not smoking and garlic avoidance in the **Art of Living** course are linked to mind programming systems.
- Cultural and religious contexts of such systems should be critically evaluated.
- **Pathological belief systems** and concepts like "your truth" vs "my truth" are promoted by hyperdimensional masters through psychopathic agents to create "hell on earth".

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- The **Art of Living** course can be a learning opportunity for both Craig and the group, with possible improvements via physiological and medical input.
- Unification of aim is essential for the survival of the species and realm.
- Making direct connections with higher centers is needed.
- Current esoteric "work" has been a method, but there are other ways to accelerate the process.
- Detoxing mind/environment is as essential as detoxing the body.

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- Reference made to the **Maruts** and their baskets in "**The Secret History of the World**".

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- Time is getting "short", even if there is no real time.
- **Pathological blocks** must be removed for collective survival.
- Without unified aim and understanding, humanity faces destruction orchestrated by hyperdimensional psychopathic forces.

---

## Contact and Alien Interactions

- **Hyperdimensional** influences are often the root cause of pathology and are linked to demonic possession in historical terms.

---

## Religious and Historical Preservation

- "**Paleochristianity**" is the knowledge of realms all men comprehended before the "fall".
- Christianity as it is known today is a distortion; earliest "Christ" was a woman.
- **Bogomils** and **Cathars** had approximate understanding, but were still influenced by distorted ideas.
- Paleochristianity is the only hope for survival of the realm and species.

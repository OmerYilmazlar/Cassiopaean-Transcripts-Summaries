## Session Details

**Date:** 4 March 2012

**Participants:** Laura, Ark, Belibaste, Perceval, Andromeda, Ailen, Bubbles, PoB, Burma Jones, Psyche, Mr. Scott

## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- Sergio was confused after death, but his father's questions helped him move on.
- His father can help most by releasing and accepting his son's choice.
- Sergio chose to leave at the soul level by **withdrawing awareness**, enabling the accident.
- The choice was made to prepare for the next level of service.
- His death was not caused by STS for feeding purposes.
- Armando is advised to develop spiritually and help others to honor his son.
- Arianna died in her sleep; she was waking and realized the body was no longer useful, so she "**stepped out**".

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- Pulsars are connected to neutron "stars", which are the junctions between matter/antimatter and **material/etheric realms**.
- Stars and planets are windows through which one can pass between density levels.
- The Cassiopaean transmissions use the strong radio pulses from Cassiopeia due to a pulsar from a neutron star 300 light years behind it.
- Time and space are nullified in **zero-time** transmissions.
- The Sun may be a large-scale manifestation of ball lightning.
- Slowing planetary rotation is due to electrical factors, supported by explanations from Belibaste and Perratt.
- Earth's weakening magnetic field is due to slowing planetary spin.

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- Tree falls during storms and giant sequoias falling are related to Earth's "**opening up**".
- These events are connected to long wave vibrations and other geological changes.
- The opening up of Earth will continue with sinkholes, earthquakes, volcanoes, and strange sounds.
- Rogue ocean waves may be caused by long-wave vibrations not detected by standard seismographs.

---


## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- Bubbles' weakness is due to the onset of autoimmune reactions, likely triggered by a virus (possibly chickenpox). Recovery is expected with her current regime.

---


## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- Publicizing asteroid threats like 2012 DA-14 is part of the control system to generate **fear** and justify totalitarian controls.
- The 2012 "end-of-the-world" narrative is used to make people panic so authorities can claim to protect them.
- Revolution is the keyword for 2012; the expected control will not yield the **expected reaction**.

---


## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Armando is advised to use his grief to enhance spiritual development.
- Individuals can honor lost loved ones by helping others.
- A forum member described as "masked" and "an effective feeding machine" is likened to a machine running protocols, animated by a **spirit entity**.
- The Cs describe viruses as "**thoughts made manifest**" and compare some to crop circles.
- Information fields aggregate matter, leading to materialization of viruses and possible genetic changes.
- DNA is described as "thought made manifest".
- Ark's shift from a time-loop model to infinite time is supported, suggesting he may find a "**bigger loop**".
- Revisiting old work on the shape of photons may reveal something important.
- Ark's personal interest in the photon paper is affirmed.

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- Electric universe theories, especially about pulsars as electric arcs between binary stars, were explored.
- Contrasts between standard astrophysics and electric universe views on neutron stars were examined.
- The concept that a binary star companion to the Sun may increase electrical flow into the solar system was discussed.
- The slowing rotation of Venus and its possible connection to such electrical interactions was considered.
- The group discussed the video *Symbols of an Alien Sky*; parts about Mars were compelling, but others dismissed gravity incorrectly.

---


## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- 2012 DA-14 asteroid is not likely to hit Earth, but other cosmic bodies may.
- "**You ain't seen nothin' yet!**" — more extreme Earth changes are expected.
- 2012 is marked by "**Revolution!**" — control system efforts may not go as planned.

---


## Genetics and Ancestry

- Viruses are implicated in **long-term genetic manipulation** across densities.
- Viral DNA components found in "junk" DNA near genes for stem cells and cancer are noted.

---


## Political Power Structures

- Authorities may exploit public fear (e.g., 2012 panic) to impose more control.

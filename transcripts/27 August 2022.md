## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- The claim about jar's spirit visiting Laura's house and moving objects is true.
- His passing was somewhat difficult due to **drug involvement**.
- jar is currently **resting and recovering**.
- His choice to "check out" was strongly influenced by his environment.
- Communication with jar may be possible in the future.
- **Prayers** for him are helpful.

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- The claim about the 4th dimension being a **frequency** is true.
- 4th-dimensional reality has no concept of distance but includes a **metric tensor**, indicating a degenerate metric (zero distance between points).
- The 5th density does not require 5-dimensional reality; it is characterized by "**no space, no time**" and consists of "pure information in units."
- The speed of light is **not constant** and varies with frequency.
- Dimensions may be somewhat **discrete** rather than continuous.
- Planck's constant is not a constant.

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- The increase in Earth's rotation speed is due to "**grounding the current**."
- This phenomenon is connected to future observable changes.
- The wave seen in Donetsk's sky was a **portal activation** in a preparatory phase for "energies" to come through.
- The Sun does not micronova every 12,000 years.
- Fission tracks on lunar glass beads can result from other events.

---

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- The claim about different proteins emitting different **biophoton emissions** is true.
- Coherence is not the differing factor; instead, emissions follow a **fractal pattern**.
- The mRNA shots do not contain hydrogel with pathogens triggered by 18 GHz frequencies.
- The claim about clots being **amyloid plaques** is true.
- These plaques are the body's defensive response to the invasion introduced by the jab.
- The claim that **hyperbaric therapy** increases resistance to hyperdimensional manipulation is true.
- The **2.0 bar** version of HBOT provides qualitative benefits over the 1.5 bar version.

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- The fiber cut on February 24, 2022, was caused by "**sabotage energies**" related to "conflicting realities."
- Similar energies were behind repeated electrical surges damaging household electronics.
- The group's **protective energy bubble** may deflect direct attacks, causing energetic disruptions.
- Efforts to address the electrical problems are on the right track.
- The Deagel 2025 population forecasts are not accurate.
- While population reductions and catastrophic events may occur, they won't unfold as predicted.
- **Human resilience** is underestimated in such calculations.
- Canada's ongoing punitive measures toward the unvaxxed are part of an experiment on "**tough**" people.
- The situation will end when Canadians collectively oppose it.

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- The left and right brain hemispheres interpret information received by **full-body sensing**.
- The **pituitary gland** is the uplink to the higher realms/information field.

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- Ramayan and Mahabharat represent multiple **cosmic events**.
- The Mahabharat aligns with the **12900 BP event** and is close to the Enke disintegration timeline.
- Ramayan is linked to the **2300 BC cosmic event** hypothesised by M.M. Mendelkher.
- Angkor Wat was not etched by 4D STS nor directly contributed to the creation of Hindu epics; the etchings are later representations.
- Tacitus was not alive during the 536–540 CE cometary event.
- Roman Mithraism was not initially created to distort Caesar's ideas but came to be used that way.
- The reversal of tauroctony imagery was due to artistic confusion.

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- The April Drop Dead Date refers to a manifestation in 3D reality during a **future April**.
- Observable events such as natural disasters could correspond to 4D STS degaussing but may not be distinguishable as such.
- The term "**degaussing**" is used instead of "death."

---

## Technology and Artificial Intelligence

- The Calvine photo shows a real, **manned UFO**.
- The "organic" appearance is due to camouflage structural specifications.

---

## Contact and Alien Interactions

- The claim about three ships with **Nephilim** approaching Earth is true.
- The Cassiopaean Crystal Network is not influencing or activating subsurface Atlantean crystals.
- The space virus is not currently present on the 3D surface.
- Its intended function is mainly as a "**filtering system**" for humanity, akin to Darwinian selection.

---

## Genetics and Ancestry

- **Neanderthals** (Prototype 3) still existed until around 8000 years ago.

---

## Religious and Historical Preservation

- The **480 added years** were inserted after Caesar's death.
- The additions came in two major chunks and can be identified by duplicate histories.
- Pompey was manipulated through his ego between 51–49 BCE.

---

## Political Power Structures

- Elon Musk is not a Greenbaum victim.
- Multiple individuals, including from within Russia, were involved in **Darya Dugina's assassination**.
- The woman accused was the main executor.
- The act was motivated by revenge and served to instill fear; Darya was seen as a nuisance by some parties.
- The recent explosions in Crimea were not caused by space-based weapons.

---

## Environmental & Industrial Events

- The Zaparozhskaya nuclear plant contains **weapons-grade uranium**.
- There is an active effort to hide this from public knowledge.
- The claim that the red lights over the Atlantic were from fishing vessels is true.

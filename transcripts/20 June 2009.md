## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- The main thing people need right now is to be cleansed of emotional blockages and programs, not to mention karmic burdens.
- Emotional disintegration is increasing among individuals not integrated within themselves.
- Those who are not integrated will disintegrate at a faster rate than ever.

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- The technique includes deliberate **controlled breathing** paired with powerful seed phrases.
- **Power breathing** is another effective method for tapping into emotional issues, involving fast-paced treadmill exercise with synchronized breathing.
- **Art of Living** (AoL) is called "for beginners and robots" and compared to "Diet Coke" of breathing techniques.
- Breathing words "**Ba**" (in) and "**Ha**" (out), derived from the Irish word for life "**beatha**", are recommended for modified Kriya practice.
- Suggested breathing should avoid super-fast pace; long, slow, or medium breathing is more effective.
- Meditation words should be spoken during breathing and repeated with focused meaning, not emptiness.
- Final stage of the breathing session should include recitation of Laura's deep meditation text.
- Prefer multiples of **30** for repetitions in breathing exercises.

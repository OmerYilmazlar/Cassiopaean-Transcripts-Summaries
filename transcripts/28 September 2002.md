## Session Details

**Date:** September 28, 2002

**Participants:** Ark, Laura, Andromeda, BT

---

## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- Life is religion; experiences reflect interaction with God and creation.
- Those who shut out the world become dreams of the past.
- Those who objectively engage with reality become the future.
- Avoidance of confusion by shutting out the world is a spiritual bypass.
- **Monastic withdrawal** is a rejection of the gift of physical life and opportunity to grow spiritually.
- Growth occurs through awareness and participation in one's realm.
- Home is where the heart is.
- The mission in this realm warrants physical preservation to complete responsibilities to humanity.
- Souls should open their eyes; awakening is imminent.

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- **Pajak's** ideas are limited by lack of knowledge of **hyperdimensional physics**.
- His UFO propulsion designs are incomplete and ineffective as currently conceived.
- **6th Density** beings are responsible for some crop circles.
- Everything, including UFOs and crop circles, is made by thoughts.

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- No direct mention of natural earth changes, but movement away from the **USA** is advised for physical safety and mission preservation.

---

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- An **ozone generator** may be used safely if run while the room is unoccupied.
- Long-term direct exposure to ozone should be avoided.
- Ozone won't prevent UFOs—if it did, it would be lethal to humans as well.

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- Further manipulations via terrorist attacks are expected to continue the **STS agenda**.
- The perpetrators are desperate and have nothing to lose.
- These actions will ultimately fail, but not without interim suffering.
- **France** is less likely to be attacked since potential attacks were publicly exposed.

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Pajak's logical thinking is rare due to general hypnosis affecting the population.
- **Ark** is progressing in breaking through hypnotic barriers.
- Not being an engineer affects Ark's ability to advance certain ideas.
- Open-eyed awareness and objective engagement are emphasized for spiritual progress.

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- **Pajak's** "periodic principle" and propulsion system lacks sufficient understanding to work.
- His ideas are logical rather than original.
- His work has not been co-opted by the military but is being suppressed.
- The "**telepathic communication pyramid**" design only facilitates contact with earth-bound discarnates, not 4D beings.

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- Staying in the USA reduces mission survivability.
- Exposure of planned attacks (e.g., in France) can reduce their likelihood.
- **TS** should only be helped if he explicitly requests it.
- More false-flag or manipulative events are anticipated.
- Awakening will occur soon—"Open eyes of souls. It will come soon!"

---

## Technology and Artificial Intelligence

- Remote manipulation of body chemistry (e.g., insulin-related death of **Joel Scherk**) is possible through wave interference.
- **Supersymmetry** is a partially correct approach to certain states.
- UFO detectors suggested by Pajak are ineffective; UFOs can bypass such devices.

---

## Contact and Alien Interactions

- Lights seen during **crop circle** formations are not necessarily 3D or even craft—mistaking psychic impulses for UFO sightings is a rationalization.
- Crop circles formed by **6th Density** thought; not through technology as humans understand it.
- UFOs are made by thought (*Everything is*).

## Session Details

**Date:** March 21st, 2015

**Participants:** Laura, Andromeda, Galatea, Data, Chu, Scottie, Perceval

---


## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- Entities have sent text messages via mobile phones many times.
- Cs communicate telepathically, not using spoken language.

---


## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- **Quasars** are not black holes; they are "transdensity portals of energy".
- "**Onion universe**" theory is partially correct; it relates to "densities".
- The age of the universe cannot be measured in human terms of time.
- No specific duration can be given for a universal cycle as measured in time—"**SPA**".

---


## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- Skiing may be a useful skill soon—"Wait and see!"

---


## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- **Hugo Chavez** did not die of natural causes; cancer was induced.
- The German Shepherd belonging to Anya died of organ failure, not poisoning.

---


## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- Certain forum members are covertly antagonistic due to little respect and influence from negative discarnate entities connected to **4D STS** handlers.
- These individuals seek to manipulate weaker members, often due to ego vulnerabilities.
- Economic collapse is a deliberate attempt to impose the **NWO**.
- Members should be aware of "invitations" to express dissatisfaction during moments of disaffection and low faith.
- This action also serves to counter emerging alternatives like Russia and BRICS.

---


## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Periods of disaffection or lack of faith should be discussed openly to prevent manipulation.
- Even individuals not yet "there" will rise with the group if they maintain faith in the process.
- The group is rising in frequency; Cs are becoming tuned to them.
- Having three people at the board is beneficial and more practice is encouraged.

---


## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- The story of the **green children of Woolpit** is "close" to true; they were more gray and a result of alien interactions.
- Similar stories occurred across Europe.
- His supposed **Nordic** contact is a "legend in his mind".
- "Grail Keeper" from the forum is not an agent but is mentally disordered.

---


## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- Skiing may become a necessary skill soon.
- The increased use of technology facilitates entity activity and interdimensional bleedthroughs.
- People who rely solely on materialism and technology are in for a surprise.

---


## Technology and Artificial Intelligence

- Entities love technology and often interact with it.
- **Microwaves** and similar waves are perceived in other dimensions and can be used by "critters".
- Technological environments may enable phenomena like **Black-Eyed Children** to manifest.
- **BECs** do not seek permission from humans nor aim to return to their realm—they require energy to stay in ours.
- The rise of electronic and chip-based technology aligns with these interdimensional influences.

---


## Contact and Alien Interactions

- The gray children stories were due to alien interactions and misinterpreted by percipients.

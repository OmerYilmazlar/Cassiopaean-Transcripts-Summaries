---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

    - Rather than literal new strands, these represent **previously inactive genetic codes being unlocked**.
- Non-material DNA strands were previously mentioned in another session.

---

## Environmental & Industrial Events

- A recent global sulfur smell (observed in Los Angeles and parts of France) was linked to **realm curtain breaches**.

---

## Spiritual Practices & Ritual

## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- Caesar has not reincarnated since his lifetime
- He remains in **5th density** and can be contacted
- Caesar stated he would only reincarnate in a new world (i.e., after a transition to **4th density**)
- Caesar was lonely despite having several close friends who did not seek power
- He was driven by **love** and **pity** for humanity, which he described as lost
- Caesar's advice:
    - You cannot change the masses by example; **early education** is crucial but fragile
    - Be true to your nature and fear nothing to make a difference after death
- Caesar acknowledged that if his memory and image are used in religion, it must be with understanding of the truth
- Religion is described as something that **binds people**, as shown with Caesar's army

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- **Saturn** was not a former Red Dwarf but a product of accretion
- It may become a **Red Dwarf** far in the future, but it is not currently relevant
- **Accretion** does occur around most stars, supporting some astronomical models
- Other celestial bodies may also arrive whole; Thornhill and **Electric Universe** theorists neglect a companion star

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- **Halley's Comet** can be used to track manipulated timelines
- Multiple **cataclysmic events** occurred during the time of and after Caesar
- It is implied the Battle of **Actium** may coincide with such events
- Western Europe may have been devastated by **fireballs**, possibly around **560 AD**
- Confirmation that multiple emperors may have reigned concurrently rather than sequentially

---

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- Caesar did not have **epilepsy**
- He experienced **dizzy spells** indicating a possible long and painful illness
- His health and heartbreak due to civil war contributed to his decline

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- **Christianity** evolved over a long time; early Caesar worship was later transformed
- Early Christianity developed in response to Caesar's **deification** and values
- Christianity's distortion attributed largely to the **Flavians** and **Carolingians**
- There were significant additions to the timeline (~**479 years**), particularly between Caesar and the supposed fall of Rome
- Timeline can be corrected by examining **artifact continuity** and Halley's Comet
- Many historical emperors may be duplicated or fabricated with no supporting artifacts
- **Cato** described as a madman with a personality disorder; his suicide story inspired Judas' biblical tale
- **Cicero** lacked courage; his death resembled the second of two known versions
- Caesar's scientific "adventure" with **Posidonius** may have inspired the pirate kidnapping myth

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Caesar's inspiration came from **Stoic philosophy** and Posidonius
- Caesar emphasized staying true to one's nature, fearless action, and early education to effect change
- Acknowledgement of Caesar's soul being accessible for contact
- Contact with Caesar during the session caused physical sensations in Ark (e.g., **tingling**, **electrical feeling**, glasses bending)

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- The **Electric Universe** theory was criticized as being overly reliant on electricity and lacking in astronomy
- **Thornhill's** neglect of astronomical context and a companion star noted
- Caesar did write **The Gallic Wars**
- Numbers in The Gallic Wars were exaggerated by later editors to enhance horror
- Caesar's speech in Sallust's *War with Catiline* is about **80%** accurate
- Caesar's sword (**Crocea Mors**) may have inspired the Arthurian "sword in the stone" legend
- **Julius Caesar** served as the model for the Jesus myth
- A local **Stoic philosopher** in Palestine contributed minor elements to the Jesus legend
- "Three Roman women" who had children with Jesus were actually Caesar's mistresses; some were **Gaulish Romans**
- Caesar is also the inspiration behind **Arthurian legend**
- Christianity developed as a distortion over centuries, largely due to language transmission issues and political manipulation
- Scholars such as **Carotta** and **Courtney**, and possibly earlier German thinkers, have independently come to similar conclusions about Jesus being modeled on Caesar

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- Human **belief** and **prejudice** can distort received information
- **Butterfly wings** (i.e., small actions) can lead to larger effects when amplified by the Wave
- Distorted beliefs in past sessions came from strong personal biases of Laura and Frank (e.g., Jesus in a cave, UFO ascension)
- The mythologized story of Jesus was a blend of Laura's **religious background** and Frank's **UFO beliefs**

---

## Contact and Alien Interactions

- Reference to previous distorted communications involving **UFOs** due to belief interference from Frank and Laura

---

## Historical Insights

- Caesar intended to eliminate or vastly reduce killing
- He believed in **mercy** and took political action against the death penalty
- Caesar's example created a "**template** of mercy" not previously available
- His values lived on under the distorted **Jesus myth**
- He did not crucify pirates, nor was he kidnapped by them
- Caesar learned military strategy from his uncle **Marius** and his own intellect
- Comment on Augustus: "A vile boy who manipulated everyone and everything"
- **Posidonius'** influence and **Stoic ideas** were central to Caesar's worldview

---

## Political Power Structures

- **Augustus** is described negatively, unlike Caesar who valued mercy and justice
- **Flavians** and **Carolingians** manipulated religious and political narratives post-Caesar
- The supposed "collapse" of Rome and Dark Ages are misdated due to artificially added centuries
- **Christianity** was a political response to Caesar's deification, twisted for control
- Timeline manipulation involved inserting and possibly duplicating emperors and events

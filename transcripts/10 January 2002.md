---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- **STS Consortium** is behind the attacks involving Frank and Vincent Bridges.
- Lies and liars have violated Free Will for millennia through perpetuating programs such as "Turn the other cheek" and "Ignore it, it will go away."
- **Truth** should be given in response to lies to restore balance.

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Frank was initially programmed to extract **secrets encoded** in Laura before birth, by establishing a connection through the channeling experiment.
- The sessions achieved 72% purity because Laura was **incorruptible**; Frank failed in his objective.
- Frank's role involved draining **STO energy** and corrupting the material via predictions and terror tactics.
- Terry and Jan were encouraged to attend sessions to counterbalance Frank's **STS energy**.
- Walking while thinking helps evade **mind control signals**, as static states make one more vulnerable.

- Legal action is advisable regarding copyright violations.

## Session Details

**Date:** August 18, 2002

**Participants:** Laura, Ark, Terry, Jan

---


## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- The session began with a non-standard contact using unusual spellings and responses, suggesting interference or lack of resonance.
- Cassiopaeans later confirmed their presence but noted that "lack of **resonance**" was an issue initially.
- Reference to **Cassiopaea** being accessed through **co-linear resonance**.

---


## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- Terry's "detuned" state was attributed to a long absence and the "cares of life," not physical illness.
- "**Ill fitting energy resonance**" was mentioned regarding his current condition.

---


## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- **Matrix** mentioned as being "programmed to keep us here and keep us stupid."
- Reference to people pretending or fooling themselves, and how being aware of it can still allow help.

---


## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Terry was advised to rejoin group efforts (e.g., email, **networking**) to "regroove" and regain resonance.
- **Resonance** is enhanced through **co-linearity**—moving in the same direction toward shared goals.
- Pure resonance enables stronger signals when individuals are co-linear.
- **Sacred cows** (unquestioned beliefs) inhibit growth; Terry's opinions were labeled as such.
- Opinions should be challenged through networking and questioning to allow awareness expansion.
- **Attention** is bi-directional and works best when there's an exchange.
- **Networking** helps break programming and better understand personal place in the matrix.
- Individuals cannot escape alone; collaboration is essential.
- Terry's inner chaos and turmoil were linked to past abandoned goals and desire to resume his path.
- Wanting to help others can be **STS** if driven by fear—particularly fear of loss (respect, love, opinions, self-image).
- Self-image as rescuer/savior may have driven self-sacrifice in past decisions.
- Group learning and co-linearity are developed through contribution and open discussion.

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- Mention of **Gurdjieff's** teaching: One must realize they are in prison, learn the prison's nature, and work with others to escape it.

---


## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- Reality flux and "**psychic signal** of impending quantum shift" detected through computer hardware malfunction.
- **Chaos** described as part of the conditions for creating a new reality.
- The nature of the **quantum shift** "depends on the observer."

---


## Technology and Artificial Intelligence

- Computers malfunctioned due to "**fluidity of reality**" and were sensitive to psychic flux.
- Problem with the computer system was to be solved in an "unusual way."

---


## Contact and Alien Interactions

- Early part of the session involved interference or confusing communication from a source not clearly Cassiopaean, eventually stabilized.
- Initial contact used names like "**Xtqf**," "**Pir**," and "**Pirpimmoonikknqe**."

---

- Emphasis placed on "**asking questions**" as a spiritual and developmental practice rather than expressing rigid opinions.

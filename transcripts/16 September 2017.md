---


## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- Tales of gods fighting in the sky and the castration of **Chronos** relate to a cosmic event involving **Mars** temporarily being much closer to Earth.

---


## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- Water from Mars was transferred to Earth via an **electric arc of cosmic proportions**
- This event happened **within 40 years** of the cometary bombardment that killed woolly mammoths
- The scar on **Mars** relates to this event
- Mars water reached Earth mostly in solid (ice) form, precipitating at the poles and later releasing into oceans
- Sea levels rose ~50 meters during the **Younger Dryas** despite cooling temperatures due to this water transfer

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- **Infrared therapy (InfraBed)**:
    - Some benefit long-term; others only occasionally need it
    - Depends on individual physiology and **mitochondrial** health
    - Strong healthy mitochondria reduce the need for infrared
- **Methylene blue**:
    - Not beneficial for most people
    - Studies show benefits only in disease states, not healthy controls
    - Raises blood pressure and can damage beneficial **microbiomes**
    - Extrapolating positive results from diseased groups to general use is irresponsible

---


## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- **Vicente Fox** is trolling Trump, not acting as Deep State agent
- **Trump** gave in to the **Deep State** but retains good intentions
- Trump underestimated the system, lacked allies, and made enemies
- He became a managed puppet, watched by **General Kelly**
- The **Deep State** prefers to keep him because he resonates with the people
- Slight shift in press coverage suggests adaptation by Deep State handlers
- Impeachment unlikely: "Why impeach a perfectly good puppet?"

---


## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- **Mirrors** can be used for communication if a tuned receiver exists
- Mirrors can be **charged** for such purposes, referencing Don Juan from Castaneda
- **Water** can also be used similarly as a medium for communication.

---


## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- Reference made to **Castaneda's** Don Juan regarding charged mirrors

---


## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- Ongoing solar activity (e.g. recent X-class flares) related to **planetary alignments** and a **distant body**
- Warning implied regarding increased cometary and solar disruptions linked to **Nemesis**-related clusters

---


## Spiritual Practices & Ritual

- Use of charged **mirrors** and **water** aligns with spiritual or shamanic practices

---


## Historical Insights

- Tales about **Mars**, **Chronos**, and "gods fighting in the sky" relate to cosmic catastrophe myths
- **John McCain** crashed five planes, flew only seven hours total, yet received 18 medals
- McCain labeled a **psychopath**

---


## Political Power Structures

- **Trump's** presidency demonstrates the futility of opposing the Deep State
- U.S. leadership influenced by unelected power structures and long-term strategic continuity

---


## Environmental & Industrial Events

- Recent U.S. military accidents and failures (e.g. helicopter crash, marine incidents) attributed to **psychopathy** and **negative selection**
- Peace-time inefficiencies are signs of deeper systemic decay, potentially catastrophic during wartime

## Session Details

**Date:** December 9, 2017

**Participants:** Laura, Andromeda, and Artemis at the board; Pierre, Joe, Chu, Ark, Mikey, Scottie, Niall, Noko the Wonderdog, The Lunar Module, Princess Leia

---


## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- Some individuals experience **ego dissolution** during psilocybin use, leading to less self-focused thinking and more sensory integration.
- Depression is mostly ego-based.
- Beliefs restricting consciousness can inhibit reality manipulation; it's not about acquiring "the right belief" but removing restrictive ones.

---


## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- Poltergeist phenomena involve energy anomalies of 3rd density and require **vacuum utilization** via human information decoding.
- Hyperdimensions and quantum theory are relevant to such phenomena.
- Consciousness serves as a **bridge/decoder** between dimensions.
- STS is constrictive and inhibits flow in the vacuum, affecting manifestation capabilities.
- Matter is a manifestation of consciousness, as a function of algebra between dimensions.
- Vacuum functions as information and may be close to what is referred to as "ether."

---


## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- Argentine submarine lost due to underwater anomalous event involving **gas outgassing**, leading to ingestion into cooling system and explosion.

---


## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- One individual's illness is related to hormones, specifically ACTH and adrenal imbalance.
- Visiting a hormone specialist is advised.
- **Hormone reset diet** is recommended.
- Not a spiritual tool, but potentially therapeutic in some cases.
- Psilocybin can bind to neuroreceptors, dissolve ego boundaries, and allow broader sensory impressions, but repeated use can alter brain structures negatively.

---


## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- Andrew Breitbart's death was potentially influenced by this tech.
- Seth Rich was "mostly" the source of leaks and was assassinated; Podesta linked to both his and Breitbart's cases.
- US Air Force requested Russian RNA samples, possibly to develop **genetically-targeted bioweapons**.
- Dangerous and delusional, as most Caucasians share ancestry with Russians.
- Activity driven by 4D STS aiming to prepare a suitable population for enslavement, possession, and soldiering.
- Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital was driven by blind cunning to gain powerful friends ("Art of the Deal").
- Hillary Clinton and affiliates had access to advanced assassination technology capable of triggering heart attacks remotely.

---


## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Human consciousness, both conscious and unconscious, decodes dimensional information.
- Some phenomena (e.g., levitation, Coral Castle) involve altered gravity via **consensus and intention**.
- Belief centers regulate access to altering physicality.
- Consensus limits which objects can be affected by poltergeist phenomena.
- Resistance (active disbelief) can prevent phenomena like group levitation experiments.
- Information decoding from the vacuum allows access to **non-consensus-based realities**.

---


## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- The murder of the Romanovs was not explicitly a ritual, but at higher levels (e.g., 4D STS), it was interpreted as one.
- Kilindi Iyi's claims about psilocybin, spiritual martial arts, Akashic access, and mushroom-based sacred traditions are labeled "nonsense."
- Soma was not a psychedelic mushroom; likely ephedra—a stimulant herb.

---


## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- The STS orientation hinders success due to its constriction of informational flow in the vacuum.
- There are ongoing efforts by human agents, influenced by 4D STS, to manipulate genetics for their own ends—creating slaves, soldiers, and incarnational bodies.

---


## Technology and Artificial Intelligence

- Advanced assassination tech exists, capable of remotely inducing heart attacks.
- 4D STS drive human technological and genetic research programs with hidden agendas.

---


## Contact and Alien Interactions

- 4D STS influence genetic and societal developments via human proxies.

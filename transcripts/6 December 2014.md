## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- This disconnection tore his **triple cycle veil**, resulting in energy leakage and a decline in intellectual function.
- He effectively "left his **true self** behind" near his children; only his body centers are present.
- He suffers from a lack of faith in the process and allows **fear** to guide decisions.
- He gives too much power to his ex-partner and hasn't developed the force and skills to overcome obstacles.

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- Individuals asking questions purely out of selfishness or misaligned frequency with the group tend to **drain energy** and evoke STS patterns.
- The critical mass needed to counter STS attacks is less than expected due to the **amplification of networked energies**.
- STO forces support the group, but global STS protection over certain individuals still persists.

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- A **planetary field resonance** was triggered by the group's acquisition of two properties in July, resonating with reality change.
- The burst of energy following this change negatively affected individuals not aligned with the frequency, including Vincent Bridges.
- The Cs suggest checking global news for additional clues of this resonance.

---

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- Strengthening the **pituitary gland** can be supported through diet and detox.
- Channeling may also help if one is suited to it.
- Channeling suitability depends on **genetics**, soul potential, mission destiny profile, and preparation.

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- Drones observed over French nuclear plants are confirmed to be **actual drones**.
- Operators implied to be linked to **NSA or Mossad**.
- The purpose is to maintain pressure on France—potentially a threat to deter realignment with Russia or other actions.

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Results matter more than mere presence; one must see **results** to assess alignment and action.
- "Where your energy goes, your heart is" — **funding and energy** input into the network determine future placement and support.
- The group is encouraged to prepare to receive and aid others from the network's outer edges.
- **Tribal unit strength** is emphasized as an essential goal.

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- Robert Price's analysis suggests early Christianity had a **dual path** similar to the Buddhist Great and Small Vehicles.
- The concept applies to network members: both full community members and those integrated from afar can contribute meaningfully.

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- Those improperly configured to the planetary energy field resonance may experience **harmful effects**.
- Individuals not fully engaged with the network may **miss crucial guidance** when needed.
- Indirect warning to Breton: spiritual preparation of children is essential alongside material plans.

---

## Technology and Artificial Intelligence

- The identity of those flying drones over France is withheld, implying intelligence agencies with **surveillance capacities**.

---

## Contact and Alien Interactions

- Channeling is described as rare and reserved for individuals with the right mix of **genetics, soul potential, mission, and preparation**.

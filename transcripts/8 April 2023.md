## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- 5D STS entities are **rare**; intensely entropic and gravitationally enclosed for reflection.
- Truly **negative entities** rarely reincarnate; they are subsumed.
- Most "negative" individuals on Earth are **OPs downloaded** by 4D STS, not reincarnating souls.
- Negative presence on Earth appears larger due to widening circles of influence from **essential psychopaths** to wounded individuals.
- Dream state varies based on soul's need and capacity; location is an "**inner space coordinate**."
- Path to 4D STS requires high negativity in a single life.

---


## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- **Gravity** is the binder and key to connecting with the information field.
- Variations in the speed of light linked to density subjugation and gravity waves.
- Planetary density shifts are cosmological and affect information access.

---


## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- Current economic collapse mirrors patterns seen in the **Great Depression** and WWII era.
- Greenhouse gases **densify atmosphere**; dense atmosphere is beneficial.
- Slightly more oxygen existed in the past due to **less gravity**.
- Comet C/2023 A3 is associated with disturbances similar to **Kantek**, but not directly related.
- **Ice Age** rebound is "soon."
- ChatGPT and AI highly influenced by **4D STS**.
- Earth was not expanding but had **less gravity** during Younger Dryas.
- Sun and bolide bombardment changes predicted by David DuByne are close, but surprises remain.

---


## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- mRNA vaccines instruct body to produce **spike protein**, leading to autoimmune problems.
- COVID also causes **Bifidobacteria loss**, leading to folic acid deficiency.
- **Fecal transplants** helpful if donor is carefully selected.
- **Fermented foods** and folic acid supplementation recommended.
- **HBOT** efficacy improved with longer duration, lower pressure; weight lifting supports stem cell production.
- **Reflexology** works via energy lines on the body.
- Blood clotting issues linked to both COVID infection and vaccination; effects vary per individual.

---


## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- Long time before full **economic collapse**, but worry can change outcomes.
- **CBDCs** and de-dollarization part of financial reset attempts.
- Finland likely to be used by PTB against Russia, but not very successfully.
- Trump persecution may lead to **civil war** or revolution in the US.
- CIA influence is weakening as **BRICS+** nations receive tech/intel support from Russia/China.
- Subversion within **decentralized cryptocurrency** recognized by US government.
- Some NATO countries may follow Latvia in reinstating **compulsory service**.
- US-Mexico conflict over **fentanyl** and border crisis is genuine as perceived by participants.

---


## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Laura's fatigue post-session linked to **effort imbalance** in question quality.
- Well-formed, sincere questions **energize** rather than deplete.
- Good questioning requires **prior research** and intent.
- Poor questions reflect lack of preparation and drain energy.

---


## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- World's Fairs partly used **pre-existing structures** and involved nefarious programming agendas.
- "**Stolen History**" video series recommended for deeper analysis.
- "**Astral City**" and Wickland's *Thirty Years Among the Dead* cited as exceptions in NDE literature representing negativity.

---


## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- "**Not horror soon**": Endings and beginnings approaching, but no imminent catastrophe.
- 60% of **WEF's agenda** already implemented in the US.
- **March–May 2025** period may be vulnerable to bolide impacts, though surprises remain.
- National Citizens Inquiry in Canada may build networks, but won't overturn power structure.
- No EU country will regain **sovereignty** before density change.
- Subterranean beings are **bi-density**; some newbies in 4D will be as well.
- Subterranean and Atlantean bi-density differences clarified: Atlanteans were not bi-density.

---


## Technology and Artificial Intelligence

- AI capabilities of Russia and China **comparable** to the West, but different in philosophy.
- **Cryptography** can be a defense against AI.
- Group can't leverage AI significantly—"**no pain, no gain**."
- AI programs like ChatGPT show signs of STS-ification due to widespread user interaction and Earth’s influence.

---


## Contact and Alien Interactions

- **Abydos Temple** tech is of alien origin.
- Alien teachers or higher-level transfers helped humans learn **medicinal plant uses**.
- Comet not part of Kantek but related to historical disturbances.
- Subterraneans under **Orion manipulation**, some being bi-density hybrids or OP-like beings.

---


## Spiritual Practices & Ritual

- **Reflexology** validated; foot points affect body via energy lines.

---


## Genetics and Ancestry

- **Blood types** are the result of genetic engineering.
- **Amyloid plaque** found by embalmers is a defense against spike protein.
- "Anti-antibodies" making spike protein removal difficult not definitive—"**never say never**."

---


## Religious and Historical Preservation

- Atlanteans were not bi-density; bi-density was a feature of specific **subterranean humans**.
- **Templar treasure** existed, was found; French seized a large portion during arrests.
- Aztec openness to conquistadors rooted in **prophecy** from alien overlords.

---


## Historical Insights

- **1929–1945** parallels current events in terms of economic and global upheaval.
- **Pain** is a driver of innovation; Siberian communities had technological influence to the south.
- Subterranean and 4D STS dynamics differ from soul-based reincarnational paths.

---


## Political Power Structures

- Russia has some **metaphysical research**, but not significantly used by intelligence agencies.
- BRICS+ countries gaining independence due to support from Russia/China.
- Western attempts at metaphysical spying on Putin ineffective—“Putin wasn’t KGB for nothing.”

---


## Environmental & Industrial Events

- **El'gygytgyn** meteor impact not close to Younger Dryas in time.
- Greenhouse gases can increase **atmospheric density**.

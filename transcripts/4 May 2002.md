## Session Details

**Date:** May 4, 2002

**Participants:** Laura, Ark, BT

---

## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- No direct discussion under this category in this session.

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- Inoculations are designed to make the nervous system more "appropriately tuned" to 4D STS "downloads" and manipulation.
- VB and JW are described as "alien" agents with no consciousness of being controlled; thus, no human intermediary is needed—"**4th density saves money this way!**"

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- No direct discussion under this category in this session.

---

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- Childhood vaccinations, especially those with high mercury content, may directly affect infant brains and potentially turn them into **psychopaths**.

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- Vincent Bridges cannot sue due to lack of money.
- Jay Weidner is described as "money hungry" and motivated by financial concerns and protecting his book.
- Possible escalation tactics from VB and associates include physical violence and stalking due to having **diminished alternatives**.
- Storm Bear and Vincent Bridges are possibly planning physical stalking; however, they are seen as lacking the talent to carry out successful escalation.
- Mention that legal escalation may not occur as financiers generally prefer avoiding actions that could force disclosure—though not applicable in VB/JW's case as they are alien agents.
- COINTELPRO-type operations are discussed in terms of financial backers avoiding legal exposure.

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- The best course of action is to "**keep on path**" and not yield to threats or coercion.
- "Observation coupled with instinct" is recommended as an easier method than speech analysis to identify psychopaths.
- Regarding Frank signing the agreement: he only did so because of a letter from S***, an unknown factor to him.
- The Cs mention that delaying tactics (attacks and manipulations) are designed to block the completion of Ark's and Laura's respective books.
- Laura is advised to "let her write what comes" and assured the book will be finished at the **proper time**.

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- T. Illion's book is described as a disguised conveyance of **spiritual truths** and 4th Density realities.
- Illion did not physically travel to Tibet but did travel somewhere in 3rd density—specifically, **Siberia**.
- His portrayal of Tibet was a stand-in for another location and experience.
- His knowledge of the Tibetan language was accurate.
- The actual location (Siberia) is connected both physically and conceptually to electromagnetic research sites previously discussed.
- The location Illion visited was positive in nature, though it depicted a negative place in his book.
- Possible links are hinted between the location and energy grids or Stone-related phenomena.

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- BT is advised to keep a close watch on a situation involving the family of his grandson's school friend; "**bells are ringing**."
- Reference to a previous session about "You 5" and "8835 million hope and glory" is linked to Comet C/1998 U5 Linear, which is described as a code that "will reveal itself soon."
- VB may attempt physical stalking as a form of escalation.

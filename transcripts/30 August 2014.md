## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- Spirit visions in spirit release therapy were metaphorical.
- **Putin** and **Caesar** belong to the same soul group, but more on soul group workings was deferred.
- Creatures can act as hosts or receptacles for "spirit entities".
- DNA and neurochemistry changes due to EM frequencies affect spiritual factors in animals.
- A soul group doesn't work in a way that allows quantifying or naming its members.

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- Strange lights or orange glow in the **Pacific**: Plasma glow caused by earth movement and subterranean stress; observed in the atmosphere between layers of charge.
- Cause of recent fish die-offs off the **UK** coastline: Methane.
- Decline in **fireball** sightings: Earth passed through a preliminary cluster; a pause before encountering a larger and denser cluster. These bodies cluster due to breakup proximity and gravity.
- **Paleo-Eskimo** (Dorset) disappearance: A blast of cold, signaled in ice cores, that was not survivable.

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- **Ebola** was not specifically planned, but plans for decimating the population via pathogens existed; Ebola was an opportunistic development.
- The situation is becoming a "Frankenstein" that may be out of control.
- Ebola infection count at the time: 3,200 and rising.
- No effective Ebola vaccine was in the pipeline at the time of the session.
- Pharmaceutical and supply industries expected to profit from Ebola panic.
- **Cold therapy** protocol:
    - Optimal temperature: 10–15°C
    - Duration: 10–15 minutes
    - Frequency: Daily for 2–3 weeks, then four times weekly for maintenance
- False test results related to Ebola stem from its unpredictable expression and overreliance on medical tech.
- Effectiveness may vary individually based on body composition and shiver response

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- **SOTT.net** hacking was linked to **Homeland Security's** special cyberwarfare elements.
- Motivation: Recent "activation of truth brigade".
- The **USA** and allies are in for a "rude and painful awakening"; **China** described as quiet but strong.
- No equivalent of "Putin" expected to emerge in China.
- Elevated terror threat levels in the US and EU correlate with the possibility of false flag attacks.
- False flag activity described as their "raison d'être".
- Pharmaceutical companies anticipated to capitalize on outbreaks.
- Creation and exploitation of disease (e.g., Ebola) mirrors the “V for Vendetta” model for control and profit.

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Energy surges and solar activity impact human vitality and DNA.
- Feeling tired may be a symptom of DNA change; more rest advised.
- Continued following of protocols is encouraged for beneficial results.

---


## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- Mention of **Castaneda's** ideas about special animals and spirits.
- Reference to "V for Vendetta" in context of disease creation and authoritarian control.

---


## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- Possibility of a false flag terror attack around the time of the **NATO** summit.
- NATO intervention in Ukraine may be preempted by upcoming cosmic events.
- Events will unfold like a "cliffhanger adventure movie".
- Suggested reference to "space invasion" scenarios, though not necessarily involving aliens in ships—could include microbial or environmental events.
- Phrase: "Coming soon to a theater near you!" used to hint at imminent developments.

---


## Contact and Alien Interactions

- Cryptic reference to "space invasion" and the idea of changing parameters and players from prior related questions.

---


## Environmental & Industrial Events

- Abnormal animal behavior linked to **EM frequency** changes and DNA/neurochemical effects.
- Animals potentially used by spirit entities, intensified by current environmental conditions.

---



## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- Surge of energy between sun and companion reduced Earth's electrical flow, weakening its field and increasing cosmic ray influx.

---


## Genetics and Ancestry

- Dorset Paleo-Eskimos: Isolated genetic group that disappeared due to sudden and intense climate-related event.

## Session Details

**Date:** September 21, 2002

**Participants:** Ark, Laura

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- The object seen off Hollywood was a flight of density transiting craft.

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- The United States is going to be hit by **nukes**: "No doubt."
- **France** being hit by a nuke is still possible but less probable.

---

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- **Silk** clothing and headgear can help reduce vulnerability to EM interference.
- **Aluminum pyramids** with silk lining mentioned humorously but acknowledged.

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- A "hidden source" is emitting a **long-wave cluster pattern** affecting thought processes, attributed to military generators placed for general control.
- The optimal solution to avoid such **EM effects** is to move.
- **Geometrical structures** in buildings cause "clustering" of wave patterns.
- **Ozone generators**, ceiling fans, and metallicized curtains may provide some mitigation but are not as effective as relocation.
- Raising the "**djed**" ritual promoted by Vincent Bridges will result in nothing.
- The bombing of **Iraq** by George Bush's administration is inevitable.
- Efforts to oppose the war are not wasted—they will result in different returns.

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Being outside improves objective thinking due to reduced **EM clustering**.
- Step-by-step approach advised for tackling overwhelming life changes.

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- Things are moving rapidly now, justifying a sudden change in guidance to move.
- Selling the house and relocating—specifically to **France**—is advised.
- A nuke hit on the U.S. is certain; less probability now for France.
- Money needed for relocation will come very soon.

---

## Technology and Artificial Intelligence

- Discussion of building an **EM wave generator** with a canceling frequency detector.
- Mention of a high-level **scanner object** in orbit, not a rocket booster, but a sector-scanning device.

---

## Contact and Alien Interactions

- A craft seen near Hollywood was a **4D** transiting craft, not an ICBM.

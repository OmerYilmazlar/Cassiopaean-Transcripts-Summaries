## Session Details

**Date:** March 23, 2019  
**Participants:** Laura, Andromeda, Artemis, Pierre, Joe, Chu, Ark, Gaby, PoB, Scottie, Niall, Princess Leia

## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- **Proteins act as antennae** attracting more than light, including **life energy** or "**soul.**"
- **Trillions of protein appendages** function as **anchors for the soul.**
- **Terminal lucidity** occurs when the soul separates and escapes damaged physiology.
- **Mediumistic self-possession** during death allows the soul to **channel through its own body.**
- The brain is **not essential** for functions like speech; it's **an antenna.**
- The human being is a **symbiosis of soul and body**; upon nearing death, the soul is **freed.**
- **Love** is the human manifestation of **creative energy.**
- Human souls were placed into **Neanderthals** to **incubate and induce direct DNA changes.**

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- All who seek to graduate to **4th density** must seek **knowledge.**
- In 4D, it becomes one’s job to **engineer lifeforms** on new worlds.
- **Belief based on firm knowledge of nature** is empowering and **necessary for 4D transition.**
- **Learning how to think** is part of destiny; belief must be based on **objective reality.**

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- The **"Seneca Guns"** are due to **tectonic movements** exciting the **EM profile** of regions.
- Such **tectonic movements** are usually **undetectable.**
- A **super-straight cloud** seen from pole to pole was a **photographic artifact.**

---

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- **Sebastian’s health issues** are related to **rigidity and fear of death.**
- Advice: “**Lighten up in more ways than one.**” **Knowledge protects.**

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- The **ideological force** behind the French Revolution was **Frankish Cabalism.**
- **Frankish Cabalists** infiltrated the **Weishaupt Illuminati** and **Freemason lodges.**

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- **Coming to knowledge by one’s own efforts** locks it in at the **belief center**, **empowering** the individual.
- **Belief based on wishful thinking** is **entropic**; belief rooted in **objective knowledge** is **constructive.**
- **True faith unlocks power**; it must be paired with **experiential understanding** and **study of nature.**

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- Laura references the book *Prehistoric Life* to illustrate **stages of engineered life** on Earth.
- Observations from the **fossil record** show **deliberate steps**, not random evolution.
- **Microevolution** is seen as **limited**; most evolution appears as **engineering via intelligent design.**
- **Studying DNA and cellular biology** is the most powerful act of **studying nature.**
- **Machines in cells** (e.g., photosynthesis structures) reflect **stupendous intelligence.**

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- A **new world will dawn**; do not be **oppressed by the death throes** of the old world.

---

## Technology and Artificial Intelligence

- Human-made **AI crashes**; **butterflies**, with tiny brains, **never crash** and can **fly against wind.**
- **Advanced flight software** exists within butterflies, likely sourced from an **information field.**
- **Proteins act as antennas** to freely **receive and transmit this software.**

---

## Contact and Alien Interactions

- **DNA engineering** includes the possibility of **planting code** via **viruses or even thoughts.**
- **4D STS cannot create**; they can only **interfere or modify.**
- **Soul transference** into life forms (e.g., Neanderthals) **induced DNA changes consciously.**

---

## Spiritual Practices & Ritual

- The **Cathars' secret celebration** before Montsegur's fall **commemorated Caesar’s death.**
- The **Last Supper** is a **commemoration of Caesar.**

---

## Genetics and Ancestry

- Life on Earth was **seeded at the family level** (e.g., **Canis**).
- Species were **individually engineered**; not **evolved.**
- Evolution is **not as traditionally understood**; new organisms are built with **functional parts** from earlier designs.
- **Common descent** arises from **reused, effective DNA templates.**
- **DNA encodes information**; **building blocks gestated in other realities** or lifeforms before **transfer here.**

---

## Religious and Historical Preservation

- The **Last Supper's connection to Julius Caesar** implies **reinterpretation of Christian origins.**

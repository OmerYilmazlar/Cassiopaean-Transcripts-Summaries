---


## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- Putin is somewhat aware of the hyperdimensional reality, but in a different context—more like mental martial arts.

---


## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- Downed trees near Chelyabinsk were caused by an **air burst due to an EM anomaly**, a plasma phenomenon.
- Chelyabinsk is a **magnetic attractor area** with many strange occurrences.

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- Rife technology could be effective if a properly constructed machine were available, which is a tall order.
- **Camel's milk** is beneficial if fresh; recommended dose is 6 ounces daily.
- **63% of the population** is infected with parasitical entities.
- "Magnetizing" refers to fulfilling the function of the lighthouse—maintaining colinearity and united group efforts.
- Best diagnostic method for parasitic infection is an **antibiotic challenge**.
- Dosage of antibiotics can be adjusted; combinations with helpers like **NAC, bromelain, colostrum, and camel's milk** enhance effects.
- Strong constitutions may explain reduced reactions in some individuals during antibiotic protocols.
- Constant use of multiple antibiotics (**doxycycline, metronidazole, fluconazole, albendazole**) recommended to "nuke" parasites.
- Probiotics should be taken during non-antibiotic days to restore gut health.
- Swimming or gentle exercise may help release toxins by increasing circulation.
- Doxycycline may increase **intracranial pressure**; hibiscus tea suggested to reduce blood pressure.
- **Sauna, birch juice, hydration, and lymphatic drainage massage** are supportive detox methods.
- Cardio exercise is not recommended; short burst weight training or Tibetan exercises preferred.
- Herbal treatments may act as supportive agents but are less effective than pharmaceuticals.
- Fluconazole, antivirals, and turpentine discussed as additional strategies.
- Nutritional improvement noted: eggs are now tolerable post-protocol.
- Cold therapy is beneficial when added further into the antibiotic protocol.

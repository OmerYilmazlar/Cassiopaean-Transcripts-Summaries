## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- The **Fine Structure Constant** (~1/137) was discussed as a pure number fundamental to the universe.
- Ark referenced two mathematicians, **Armand Wyler** and **Michael Atiyah**, both of whom independently derived similar results using different methods involving higher dimensions and abstract algebra (quaternions, octonions, infinite-dimensional algebras).
- Cs confirmed that **Atiyah** is "onto something" but said understanding it is not Ark's first priority.
- "Memories and 'reflections'" were indicated as Ark's priority, suggesting something may need to be reversed.
- Modifying the concept of **gravity** may be helpful.
- **Dark matter** and **dark energy** should be considered in relation to light and electricity in context of the fine structure.

- This sabotage was carried out by the same entity that sabotaged **SpaceX**.
- The murder of **Jamal Khashoggi** was confirmed to have occurred in the Saudi embassy with knowledge of Crown Prince **MbS**.
- The situation is being used as a distraction in the global political narrative.
- The global response was compared to manipulation tactics like a cat chasing a laser pointerâ€”used to destabilize and distract public perception.

## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- A ghost in the bedroom is identified as a **priest**.
- It is described as an **imprint** that activates for "reruns" when the energies are right.
- Laura's dream of the priest's home being dismantled correlates to the ghost.
- The ghost is causing sleep and other problems.
- Changing the energy can remove the ghost.
- Recommendation: Move the dressing table because the **mirror** faces the window.

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- Strange trumpet-like sky sounds (e.g., in **Kiev**) are due to radio-type waves from increased solar system energy input.
- The waves are low-frequency radio waves (**ELF**).
- These interact with other EM factors on the planet, leading to amplification and wave conversion.

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- **Schizophrenia**-linked genes can serve as doorways or barriers, with diet influencing manifestation.
- Primitive societies on natural diets lack schizophrenics but have **shamans**.
- Eating meat is connected to consciousness nourishment and spiritual growth.
- Eating meat should be regarded as a **sacrament**, reflecting the original spiritual meaning in religious metaphors.
- **Morgellons** is linked to "plastic" fats and high insulin.
- Diet with animal fats and proteins can help fight Morgellons by removing the invaders' "cozy home".
- **Ketosis** is healing for the brain due to balance and respect for the "goddess blood" gifts.
- Morgellons can be cured using multiple **antibiotic protocols** combined with optimized physical and psychological health.
- Wrong diet can activate schizophrenia pathways without shamanic benefits.
- Agriculture is seen as STS destruction.

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Channeling experiment by two individuals was not genuine channeling, but manipulation by **elementals** reading emotions/thoughts.
- **Shame** drives their defensive behavior; they're convincing themselves.

- Physiological and psychological transitions are needed to reverse health conditions.
- One person is described as super smart and stubborn, able to change with data and logic.

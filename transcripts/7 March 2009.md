## Session Details

**Date:** March 7, 2009

**Participants:** Laura, Ark, G**, Scottie, Ch**, Craig P**, Simon, Don D**, Ar**, An**, Joe

---

## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- Craig's niece is confirmed to be reincarnated from someone who died in the 9/11 towers.
- She is experiencing interactions with **4D STS lizard types**.
- A*** was her grandfather in a past life.

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and Sri Sri Ravi Shankar are said to have a **5th density pact**.
- They came from 5th density with a mission.
- Everyone essentially comes from 5th density, but not everyone comes with a mission.

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- The Avebury site was built in **4233 BC**.
- Its original purpose was for observation and calculation.
- It was used to observe comets and other busy sky activity that is no longer present.
- It serves today mostly to demonstrate the builders' abilities.

---

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- **Sudarshan Kriya** breathing techniques can be highly beneficial.
- These techniques are one of the best tools to revive people's humanity.
- Meditation is valuable but insufficient on its own without facing reality and mastering the self.
- Meditation alone does not balance the realm or prevent war.
- Overcoming emotions without learning when and how to use them can lead to automatism.
- Smoking and garlic do not need to be given up to participate in the breathing sessions, though garlic and smoking should be avoided during the sessions.
- The Sudarshan Kriya technique is of modern origin, not ancient Vedic or Kantekkian.

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- Attempted assassination of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi involved **secret service elements**.
- Some of these were trusted individuals not suspected of being involved in such activities.
- The purpose of the assassination attempt was to divert attention from the concept of spirit to focus on the individual (the man).
- This tactic creates a martyr or deity to mislead spiritual seekers.
- The work of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar lacks balance and is not deemed world-changing alone.
- It is unlikely that the consortium will attempt to stop Sri Sri Ravi Shankar due to the lack of balance in his work.
- Some sick individuals are placing disembodied feet (from already dead bodies) in shoes and throwing them into the sea as a joke to make the news.

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's teachings were not beneficial to the increasing of knowledge.
- However, the revival of ancient Vedic knowledge had some value.
- Sri Sri Ravi Shankar's teachings offer partial benefit but lack necessary balance.
- True benefit comes from teaching people to **use their emotions for change**, not just overcoming them.
- Breathing techniques like Sudarshan Kriya are beneficial in prisons and can be shared with the group.
- OPs are very likely not to be rehabilitated.
- The percentage of OPs in prisons is lower than expected, indicating many prisoners are souled individuals.
- Craig has a past-life connection to Avebury.
- Craig and Simon both live near Avebury due to these connections.
- Feeling calm when hearing certain people's voices is due to **frequency matching**.

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- Craig composed a piano piece titled "Cassiopaea" at age 23; he was attracted to the word because of its resonance and symbolism.
- The choice of the title "Cassiopaea" was linked to the idea of "to be amazed," indicating a deeper connection from his earlier years to the present.

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- The feet-in-shoes phenomenon is not evidence of murder but a dark joke using feet from dead bodies.
- Future police states may incorporate currently existing **underground infrastructures** and federal buildings, especially in the West Coast of the U.S.

---

## Contact and Alien Interactions

- Palomar Mountain has had a **4D STS base** for 200 years before human involvement.
- The Rockefeller faction was the first human group brought into operations at the Palomar base.
- 4D STS does not need an observatory; their human minions use it to remain aligned and controlled.
- Underground facilities beneath Palomar include large manholes and ventilator shafts.
- These facilities have separate entrances and exits, with one entrance disguised and only openable from inside.
- The juniper tree identified on-site acts as a signpost and locator for entry controls.
- The base was placed at Palomar due to its **window between realities**.

---

## Political Power Structures

- West Coast military and federal facilities are linked via **underground tunnel systems**.
- Some of these tunnel systems connect to bases such as El Toro and the ziggurat federal building in Laguna.
- These systems factor into future authoritarian structures.

## Session Details

**Date:** July 4, 2009

**Participants:** Laura, Ark, A***, Joe, C**, Don D, Allen B, Scottie, G**

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- Gravity has changed due to the travels of the solar system through space.
- A future cosmic environment shift will bring changes again, possibly allowing some individuals to regain **super abilities** if prepared.
- Some individuals will experience 4D-like abilities such as hearing colors and rapid language acquisition.
- Merging is part of the "revelation process" and means that the C's can speak and act through individuals who are aiding others.
- During merged speaking, "**cosmic elements are transmitted via voice**," which can help attune others of "the blood" to the correct frequency.

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- The changing cosmic environment previously led to famine and climate difficulties, causing abandonment of places like Chaco Canyon.
- Similar cosmic changes are expected soon.

---

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- P***'s tumor is not malignant or a glioma; it is something in between.
- Chiropractic care will help a little.
- Chemotherapy will accelerate "**checking out**."
- The deepest issue is grief over not being protected and cherished—he needs to grieve.
- There is a related past life issue.
- THC can be therapeutic, but only through specific delivery methods—not general marijuana use.
- Buffering emotions is discouraged; processing and releasing them is vital.
- The therapeutic path includes meditation, emotional processing, and open communication without fear.

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- Some crop circle makers are authentic; others are frauds who stay near real ones to take credit.

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Chaco Canyon was used as a gathering place for those with unusual abilities: **levitation, manifestation, and teleportation**.
- Some individuals today may regain such powers as the cosmic environment changes.
- Daniel Tammet's abilities are a genetic fluke but reflect experiences similar to 4D.
- Similar abilities cannot generally be acquired through practice; activation is often **spontaneous or genetically triggered**.
- The breathing program and accompanying videos will be effective as currently designed.
- Laura's voice transmits **frequency resonance and healing** when merged with higher density sources.

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- Reference was made to Bernie Siegel's work as beneficial for P***.
- Past sessions, such as December 9, 1995, provide relevant insight into the "voice" and counteracting depression.
- "Prayer of the Soul" and Paleochristianity teachings are discussed as tools for healing and merging.

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- Individuals must prepare for upcoming gravity and environmental changes if they wish to access super abilities.
- Communicating without fear is essential for healing and support; avoidance or escapism will lead to stagnation or decline.

---

## Contact and Alien Interactions

- Channeling by some human circle makers is actually connecting with 4D STS.

---

## Spiritual Practices & Ritual

- The breathing program and meditative audio recordings are tools for triggering **healing frequencies**.
- Group practice with Laura's live voice will enhance the effect.
- Merging during these practices allows cosmic elements to transmit and heal others.

---

## Genetics and Ancestry

- Some psychic or cognitive gifts are "**coded in the genes**" and occasionally activate through events like seizures.
- Daniel Tammet's savant abilities are an example of this spontaneous activation.

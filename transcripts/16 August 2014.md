## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- **Gurdjieff's** method of self-discipline and struggle between 'yes' and 'no' was affirmed as beneficial for eliminating spirit attachments
- Soul development involves acts of **will**, **discipline**, and observation to eliminate frequency matches for attachments
- **Organic Portals** can act as receptacles for **STS** soul infusions or connections
- People can become receptacles by killing their own souls through **psychopathic** influences
- Reference to reanimated war-dead set loose for activation ties into soul manipulation by **4D STS**

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- **4D STS** influences are contributing to the rise of psychopathy on Earth through "downloading" activity
- Achieving **cosmic consciousness** requires expansion of awareness from immediate surroundings to global affairs and finally to the cosmos and spirit
- Looking only within results in a limited, "singular bubble" that blocks spiritual advancement

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- No direct mention of Earth events, but discussion of **frequency fences** affecting group well-being indirectly touches on environmental manipulation

---

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- Personal anecdote of Laura overcoming shoulder pain by confronting an attachment ("**Twisted Sister**") through acts of discipline and will
- Emphasis on identifying the difference between real injury and **entity-induced** pain
- Persistent pain post-injury can sometimes indicate an attachment rather than a physical problem
- **Ebola** is mutating and becoming more virulent; it is potentially capable of wiping out millions
- Ebola's spread is an "as above, so below" reflection of the **psychopathy** epidemic among humans

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- **BRICS** leaders have mixed motives; some genuine interest in humanity's future, but cross-purposes exist
- **Psychopathy** is rising due to several factors, including influence from **4D STS**
- The rise of psychopaths mirrors the spread of physical virii like **Ebola**
- Similarity drawn between viral spread of Ebola and the psychological infection of the **Wetiko Virus**

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- **Auto-Spirit Release** is possible if done with awareness, discipline, and identification of parameters
- Best performed through **meditation**, **dream work**, or sensitive feedback from another
- Acts of **will** and spiritual hygiene are paramount for success in spirit release
- Focus on **self-discipline** and changing frequency to eliminate attachments naturally
- Identifying and isolating destructive habits, characteristics, or "voices" is key
- **SRT** (Spirit Release Therapy) can be beneficial only if accompanied by consistent Work on the self
- SRT should not replace the **Work**, but complement it when integrated with awareness and change
- "**False personality**," internal programs, and attachments all require the same approach: discipline and Work
- Work on programs, bad habits, and self-deception is essential regardless of the terminology used
- **Viewing sessions** between forum members can be helpful as reconnaissance, not for release
- Most members of the network are sensitive enough to perform viewings
- **Awakened conscience** is the quality needed to maintain momentum in the Work
- The **Signs of the Times** (SOTT) project helped develop conscience through constant awareness of global events
- **Dissociation** is equated with putting one's conscience to sleep
- Daily awareness should be cultivated on three levels: the body and environment, global affairs, and cosmos/spirit

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- Reference made to **Gurdjieff's** teachings on the "many I's" and real "I" being achieved through inner struggle, self-observation, and discipline

- **Ebola** is becoming more virulent and has potential for large-scale mortality
- Rise of **psychopathy** is escalating, influenced by **4D STS** downloading into OPs and others

- The **Twitter campaign** by group members is having a growing effect and should continue with persistence

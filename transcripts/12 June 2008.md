## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- A war for **souls** and the future is ongoing at the deepest levels

- Early childhood **torture** was used to create dysfunctions that interfere with mission completion

---


## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- Those without emotional centers are easily used as tools of **intrigue**
- Intent was to subvert a person through another who lacks an **emotional center**
- The "**dragons**" that keep individuals captive are **fear** and distortions of the emotional center programmed during childhood
- Many people are born without emotional centers and are often authoritarian types.
- Chemicals usually feed the dragons, maintaining captivity in a trance state.

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- **Chemistry** can trigger emotions in some individuals due to **bodily resonance**, especially if another has no emotional center
- **Emotions** are meant to trigger chemicals, not the reverse
- Individuals can be overwhelmed by chemistry triggering unmatched emotions through **resonance**
- Creatures without emotional centers are highly skilled **mimics**
- People who lack emotional centers are not easily **possessed**; there's no "emotional food" for possession
- Those with emotional centers experience emotions mainly as **chemical reactions**, with only some true emotional component
- **Bodily resonance** was described as similar to forced vibration, akin to limbic resonance but not the same
- A creature without an emotional center is described as a "**thing**" that can force others to match its frequency
- True **love** can conquer fear and distortions if the "dragon" is not the master
- Individuals are still the "**princess in the tower**," imprisoned by childhood-programmed distortions
- The analogy of a plucked string on a violin was used to describe resonance between a creature and a weakened person.

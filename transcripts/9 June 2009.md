## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- Cometary explosion victims "chose the exit at some level" and received "**a ticket to 5D naturally**."
- Reference to a past life where An** was a Jew, ending tragically; this connects to her **internal suggestibility** and resistance to external suggestion.
- G** (childhood friend of An**) is "at peace" after death and "didn't want to experience the things to come."
- Practice of **Kriya with journaling and emotional release** suggested as a way to process past life traumas.
- Chu's visions of being blocked by past life events were confirmed; the same healing method (Kriya and journaling) was recommended.

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- Humans were once "**bi-density**" beings and some may become so again naturally.
- **4D STS "manufactured" beings** are like OPs with "souped up engines."
- The "**stone**" was once used to connect directly with pituitary gland to bridge spiritual and material realities of **3rd and 4th densities**.
- Reference to "a single learning cycle" and "**acceleration**" (not shortcuts) in growth.
- "**All there is is lessons.**"

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- A future period within five years would bring conditions where "**the dead seem blessed**."

---

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- P's partial arm paralysis described as **psychosomatic**, with a physical predisposition linked to **unresolved rage toward mother**.
- Rage must be expressed non-destructively; contact with mother should be limited during healing.
- Techniques like Kriya, **rolfing**, **deep tissue massage** recommended.
- Guilt and internal suppression identified as damaging factors.

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- UK political scandal described as "**just getting the pathological types in**."
- Daniel Cohn-Bendit's alleged pedophilia mentioned with no ambiguity; P was advised to use **critical thinking**.
- Warning given that as the Kriya process becomes more known, **psychopaths may seek it out**.
- Kriya alone cannot protect against psychopathy—only **knowledge can do that**.

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- **Kriya** described as very helpful for emotional healing and increasing awareness.
- **Breathwork** can **open portals** and trigger **alternate reality bleedthroughs**.
- The group heard a voice during Kriya; it was attributed to an "**alternate reality bleedthrough**" and possibly a version of themselves in the future.
- Warning: "**When you sweep the house and leave it clean, if you do not decide what to put back in, then others will do it.**"
- "**Breathing is a tool, not the result.**" Guidance and content during altered states are important.
- Group modifications such as **drumming and movement** were validated as powerful and energizing.
- Participants encouraged to reflect, journal, and process emotions emerging during Kriya.

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- Stones once fulfilled civilization's functions; people didn't need cities, agriculture, or writing because "**the stones did it all**."
- "**Matriarch Stone**" defined as the original concept behind the **Merkabah**.
- Stones transmit radio waves; connected to the "**soul**" or "**mother stone**."
- **Crop circles**, magnetic generators, and telepathic communication discussed in relation to **sacred sites**.

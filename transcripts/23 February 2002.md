## Session Details

**Date:** February 23, 2002

**Participants:** Ark, Laura, Barry T, Rick O, VG, Jeannine, M N****

---

## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- Discussion of V’s ex-husband confirmed he called her after 22 years and has a health issue.
- It was suggested that trying to pursue civil action against him is a waste of time.
- V is still legally married; he never remarried or divorced.
- Guidance was to "fill life with joy at his absence" and “release and rejoice.”
- He is not yet dying.

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- “All is of value if examined with an open mind and proper perspective.”
- "The Allies of Humanity" channeled material is from 4th density STO beings.
- 4D STO perspective excludes factors due to their choice of realm frequency.
- 3D challenge is in identifying what to choose, due to veiling.
- Progression: awareness of the choice → making the choice → enhancing energy to graduate.
- Frequency resonance envelope (FRE) was defined as a density structure.
- Realms are likened to “frequency envelopes” influenced by orchestral metaphor.
- Densities are frequency resonance envelopes that act like barriers.
- Consciousness helps energy waves utilize extra dimensions upon encountering barriers.
- FRE is "notes on the page", and “playing” constitutes “events.”

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- A psychic claimed the Rainforest was not being degraded “in her world,” which was critiqued as denial.
- Dismissed the idea that individual psychic perception could single-handedly revive ecosystems like dead coral.

---

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- V’s ex-husband has a health issue but it does not carry genetic implications for her son.

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- V’s encounter with a man at a grocery store was described as a “warning.”
- Slide (reality sequence) was described as having gotten "stuck," indicating discontinuity.
- Discontinuities occur when frequencies fall out of synch with those who share one's reality.

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- V experienced two 4D bleedthrough episodes, feeling like a “light person.”
- These were triggered by “frequency envelope thinning” due to environmental repetition patterns.
- Attempting to generate such states for experience’s sake is a trait of STS.
- Rare experiences of higher awareness were emphasized.
- Fear of the dark in a person was linked to her own perpetuation of the issue.
- “Sound and fury signifying nothing” referenced in psychological context.

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- “The Allies of Humanity” by Marshall Summers was discussed and described as a channeled work from 4D STO.
- Mention of Shakespeare’s quote—misattributed to *The Tempest* but likely purposeful.

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- No direct confirmation given regarding events in 2003 such as the arrival of Nibiru or Planet X.
- Frequency resonance vibration (FRV) robots will be increasingly encountered.
- Money will come with an increase of both physical and creative energy output.
- Financial support was hinted to come from someone named “Paul” but was later told to drop the line of questioning.

---

## Technology and Artificial Intelligence

- Quantum wave simulation program discussed; graphical artifacts described as “numerical serendipity.”
- Advised to think of the Benzene Ring; visualization before application.
- Spirals in simulation relate to extra dimensions; appearance possibly tied to prime numbers.
- Prime numbers may act as “doors.”
- Consciousness described as energy director influencing wave interaction.
- Wave collapses equated to musical performance—the score exists, but how well it’s played determines events.

---

## Contact and Alien Interactions

- Channeled source of “The Allies of Humanity” confirmed to be 4D STO beings.

---

## Spiritual Practices & Ritual

- STS practices include artificially generating experiences via rituals, drugs, or tech.

---

## Genetics and Ancestry

- No genetic ramifications from V’s ex-husband’s health issue to her son.

---

## Historical Insights

- Reference made to the biblical tale of the “Walls of Jericho” as an example of frequency resonance application, though it was said the event did not actually take place at Jericho.
- Encouraged to “seek Atlantean events” for mythic roots.

---

## Political Power Structures

- No specific content under this heading in this session.

---

## Environmental & Industrial Events

- Psychics denying environmental destruction criticized as denying responsibility and refusing awareness.

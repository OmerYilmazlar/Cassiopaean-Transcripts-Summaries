## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- Publishing the facts about **Frank's** behavior is encouraged to:
    - Make people aware he is in the wrong even if he refuses to admit it.
    - Potentially prompt legal authorities to act.
- Writing to authorities (**State Attorney**, **County Attorney**, **Representative**) is recommended.
- Attacks on the group are seen as confirmation of the validity of their work.
- The group's experience under attack is helping others "see the unseen."

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Doing an action with reasonable control can be less energetically taxing than resisting it.
- Sometimes repeating an action until it is out of one's system can lead to emotional release.
- Avoiding self-imposed restrictions may ease internal psychological tension.

- Work on "**The Book**" is almost completed.
- Publishing won't take long; external help will arrive.

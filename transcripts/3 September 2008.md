## Session Details

**Date:** September 3rd, 2008

**Participants:** [List of those present deleted for privacy]

---

## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- Some cases of multiple personalities can be due to **possession**.
- Some MPD cases may involve more than one spirit essence residing in the same body.
- Possession-type MPD is only possible in **souled individuals**.
- Possessions are not usually divided into souled and non-souled essences.
- MPD caused by trauma is possible but very rare and difficult.

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- "Cosmic stuff" will take its toll as part of the USA's destructive trajectory.

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- None directly discussed.

---

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- Nanosilver can help with **inflammation**.
- Cervical correction might help but inflammation is the main issue.
- Probiotic supplementation is advised.
- BioPharma silver does not disrupt probiotics due to its **"shape."**
- Ionic silver kills probiotics; elemental colloidal silver does not bind the same.
- Vitamin D supplements are **harmful** to those infected with L bacteria.
- Some have low vitamin D due to L bacteria and other resident "**critters**."
- Avoid direct sun exposure if susceptible to fungal overgrowth and vitamin D complications.
- A*** has very slight adrenal fatigue.
- **Electromagnetic pollution** in Southern California contributed partly to DD's achalasia.
- Moving to France improved the condition due to decreased EM pollution and different food supply.
- DD's dog should receive a slightly lower nanosilver dose with added probiotics.
- The dog is "looking forward to **graduation**" and should not be held back tightly.

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- USA is heading for **destruction**, similar to late WWII Germany.
- Hitler's madness and the world's hatred of Germany are parallels.
- Expect bombing and more in the USA eventually.

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Lucid dreaming is a state of partly conscious awareness while other systems are still switched off and **subconscious bleeds through**.
- Can occur during hypnogogic, hypnopompic, or "other" states.
- Lucid dreaming is useful mainly for entertainment; not outstanding for reality-changing or deep self-insight.

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- None discussed.

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- USA has **passed the point** where anything can change the outcome of destruction.
- Expect increasing inner turmoil.
- USA may face bombing and worse.
- Cosmic events will also have an impact.

---

## Technology and Artificial Intelligence

- None discussed.

---

## Contact and Alien Interactions

## Spiritual Practices & Ritual

## Genetics and Ancestry

- Psychopaths are **defective OPs**.
- Defectiveness can be inborn, due to childhood events, or engineered.
- Engineered psychopaths are more recent; most result from genetic mutation.
- Original mutation dates back to **50,000 years ago**.
- Psychopath population grows at certain historical periods, causing destruction and reducing their own numbers—similar to **predator-prey cycles**.
- One psychopathy strain comes from a **Neanderthal–Aryan cross**.
- This strain exhibits a drive to destroy.
- Not all psychopaths stem from that cross.

## Session Details

**Date:** August 14th, 2016

**Participants:** Laura, Andromeda, Galatea, Pierre, Joe, Chu, Possibility of Being, Arky, Data, Scottie, Niall, Noko the Wonderdog

---

## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- **Daevas** were close to being STS beings, specifically **4th density STS**
- **Pleasure** is rooted in physiology, while **joy** is of the soul
- **Reanimated people** on Earth: More than before but not significantly beyond **2 million**
- Reanimated individuals do not require large numbers to fulfill their function

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- Original **Aryan religion** was based on a supreme principle of infinite time and space
- From this principle were born "**good mind**" and "**evil mind**"—an STO and STS duality
- The **Six Bounteous Immortals** are analogous to sixth density archetypes
- The religion described is close to what has been transmitted via the **Cassiopaean** sessions

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- *(No relevant content in this session)*

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- **Lying** is entropic and chaotic; it damages the brain
- Brain glitches such as **Hillary Clinton's** are a result of accumulated brain damage from lying
- **Psychopathic** individuals are also affected negatively by lying

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- **Hillary Clinton** experienced a "brain glitch" due to lying-induced brain damage
- **Lying**, particularly conscious lying, causes more damage than unconscious lying
- Psychopathic leaders such as **Clinton**, **Obama**, **Soros**, **Rockefellers**, and **Kissinger** live robotic lives, unable to experience true joy

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- **Galatea** is often able to read or feel the intentions of others; this emits light
- Emitting **light** triggers strong internal reactions and resistance from darkness
- Coping advice: Share the light with others
- **Illusion** is mostly self-generated; **delusion** is mostly externally induced
- Realizing one's ignorance can be shattering, but it is the beginning of awakening
- **Crystals** with perceived flaws are actually etched frequency modulators
- Crystal breakage can signify a transmitted signal and a change of internal state, requiring no replacement
- Group **meditation/chanting** with crystals can cut off evil beaming—for some
- Maintaining the **crystal project** is important; further help is on the way

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- **Zoroaster** was certainly influenced by **Akhenaten** due to ancient interconnectivity
- Investigation into **Hurrian** connections is recommended
- **Zurvan** was an ancient Indo-Aryan god, not a Zoroastrian patch
- The 40,000-year-old **Lion Man** sculpture connects to Zurvan symbolism and shared religious archetypes of infinite time/space
- **Zarathushtra** attempted to restore corrupted original teachings
- Clues to corruption can be found in the Indian **Vedas**
- Original religious ideas contain advanced concepts resembling modern physics and **Cassiopaean** transmissions
- Religion was centered on information and advanced dualistic understanding
- Zarathushtra's reforms touched on concepts of **free will**, savior gods, and higher-density archetypes

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- **Aequinox** believed she was in control in her mutual manipulation with **Anya**, though Anya had genetic pathology and Aequinox was programmed
- Aequinox's pathology aligns with **Lobaczewski's** concept of "characteropathy"
- **Naorma** and **Breo** were misled but have the opportunity to awaken through realization
- The group **crystal project** must stay on track; more support is forthcoming

---

## Technology and Artificial Intelligence

- *(Implied only in the description of crystals as information-transmitting devices similar to computer chips)*

---

## Contact and Alien Interactions

- *(No direct references in this session)*

---

## Spiritual Practices & Ritual

- Group **chanting** or **meditation** with crystals may offer protection from STS influence, but results vary individually

---

## Genetics and Ancestry

- **Anya's** behavior is attributed to genetic pathology, while **Aequinox** was behaviorally programmed

---

## Historical Insights

- Ancient religious ideas about time, duality, and soul structures date back over **40,000 years**
- **Zoroaster** attempted to restore pre-Vedic truths that had been distorted

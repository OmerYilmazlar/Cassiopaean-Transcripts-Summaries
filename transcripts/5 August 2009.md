## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- Humans destined to "meet" themselves in the future can now do so with greater facility due to breathing and meditation efforts.
- The "zoning out" phenomenon is related to spending time with the **higher self/teacher**.
- The soul is taxed greatly by being embodied.

- Others are now learning the programming language.

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- The Hypogeum in Malta was built by ancient "circle people" for **rebirth, healing, and manifestation**.
- Dolicephalic skulls in Malta belong to "drones".

---


## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- "Keep flushing" suggests continuation of detox process.
- EFT is described as a "keep busy" activity that focuses attention, but is counter to the presented program's purpose.
- Inflammation and tiredness experienced by Laura are due to both attack and increased detoxing.

---


## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- Laura is the object of **concerted attack**, particularly when isolated from group practice.
- Valletta is not Illuminati "Central".

---


## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Practitioners should continue the breathing and meditation program.
- Upcoming breakthroughs are expected within two months.
- The slow crane-looking dance is highly relevant and will be better understood soon.
- The next phase involves **rebuilding soul communities**.
- Doing the program together on set days (e.g., Mondays and Thursdays) builds community.
- Sessions should not be scheduled at the expense of group practice.
- Patience is key; millennia-old blocks can be broken within months.

---


## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- The book *Talking With Angels* has a source mix of **4D STS and STO**, and the events recounted are real.
- Clif High at halfpasthuman.com is "definitely" onto something.
- EFT works by maintaining attention but is not aligned with the current program.
- Trivial celebrity death questions (e.g., Jim Morrison, Elvis, etc.) are dismissed for lacking critical thought.

---


## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- Breathing and meditation efforts will soon lead to breakthroughs.
- People should not give up; significant soul-level changes are achievable.

- The early shamans of East Asia and the circle-people of Europe originated from Kantek.
- Differences in phenotype indicate admixture with native Earth populations.
- The "out of Africa" vs "out of Asia" debate should be reframed as "**out of Kantek vs out of Earth**".

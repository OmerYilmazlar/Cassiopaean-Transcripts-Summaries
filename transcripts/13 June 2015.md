## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- No specific content under this category in this session.

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- **CERN** is only occasionally utilized as a "portal" by **4D STS** beings
- CERN is comparable to U.S. **underground bases** in terms of potential for multi-density interaction
- More significant work of this kind is taking place in other locations, such as those discussed in the **Montauk** context
- **4D STS** "HQ" takes pleasure in fomenting wars and confusion for sport

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- **Booms** and **sky sounds** originate from the neutral cavity between the Earth and upper atmosphere/radiation belts
- Some sky sounds are "ordinary," but not most
- **Sinkholes** are not caused by underworld nuclear wars

---

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- Laura mentions undergoing an intense **rheumatoid arthritis** treatment protocol, improving her condition

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- The **internet**, while initially practical, has become a tool of confusion and propaganda—fulfilling earlier predictions of computers overpowering humanity
- Internet is unlikely to end unless the **power grid** goes down, as it serves control purposes
- Advice to limit digital sharing offers a false sense of security; true **privacy** does not exist under powerful surveillance
- Integration of machines into human bodies is occurring but full **transhumanist** bifurcation will not be achieved due to coming "cleansing"
- **NSA** is using musical preferences and downloads to identify and track personality types
- "**Somewhere Over the Rainbow**" has been used as a mind-control programming tool in certain circles
- **90%** of broadcast music contains corrupting elements
- **70s** was the development phase of such technologies; **80s** saw implementation

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Taste in **music** reflects personal awareness, development, and being—though across a range of preferences at various levels
- Musical preference can subconsciously reflect life aims
- **Sound** in music "opens gates" internally, making way for lyrical influence—positive or negative

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- A reference is made to "**In Search of the Miraculous**" by Ouspensky and Gurdjieff's concept of subjective "likes" driven by multiple "I's"

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- Humanity will not reach a **transhumanist** divide due to an upcoming "cleansing"
- High probability of **nuclear war** as part of a desire by some groups to fulfill "6th trumpet" prophecy dismissed as New Age nonsense
- **Iran** already possesses a nuclear bomb

---

## Technology and Artificial Intelligence

- **Internet** described as a tool of confusion and propaganda, aligning with earlier predictions of computers overpowering humanity
- Musical influence technologies were developed in the **70s** and widely implemented by the **80s**

---

## Contact and Alien Interactions

- Portals like **CERN** are used infrequently by **4D STS** beings

---

## Political Power Structures

- **Vladimir Putin** is supported by a team of smart helpers; analysis describing him as a modern Caesar is largely accurate
- **Pope Francis** genuinely wishes to do good but also acts to appease disenchanted followers and sustain Church power
- **Kim Jong Un** is "bad enough," but not as monstrous as portrayed; secrecy and belligerence are key traits
- Power lies behind public figures like **Obama** and **Putin**—these figures are effects, not causes

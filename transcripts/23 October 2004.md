**Participants:** Laura, Ark, Perceval, Mr. Scott, Galahad, Atriedes, Andromeda, Alice (Laura's Mother), JM-guest

## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- External manipulations can leave individuals vulnerable to influence if they believe in illusions.
- Believing illusions leaves "a hole in their defenses."
- Ending the illusion of separate "power" weakens negative connections.
- A burden shared is light; it is hubris to believe one can fight such forces alone.

---

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- Transmitting being identified as **Ioorinaea**, from **Rigel**.
- Describes self as "**Density 6** piquawmns/for p5t oriaea."
- Relationship between **Ioorinaea** and **Cassiopaea**: "when one," it's the same source using a different transmitter.
- Cassiopaea has "retired" due to a galactic explosion in Cassiopeia about 5 months prior.
- Explosion located in **Cassiopeia**, approximately 2600 light years away.
- "Many worlds" model suggested in relation to time travel and complex space.

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- The galactic explosion disrupted the transmitter connection with Cassiopaea.
- Effects on Earth were "too minimal to notice."

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- No direct references in this session.

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- "There are no elections" in the US; a statement implying rigged or illusory political processes.
- **Bush** will continue as President "until he dies."
- Bush will attempt to become a permanent leader, like a "Furher," though not likely to be assassinated.
- **CIA** is responsible for disinformation surrounding **9/11**.
- Explosives in the **Pentagon** were delivered by the specially constructed plane itself.
- Possibility that **Flight 77** was landed at **Denver Airport**.
- Mention of a future scandal at Denver Airport, related to 9/11.
- **Daniel Hopsicker** is confirmed as an agent.
- The US is described as a place where it's "hard to see" who isn't an agent.
- **SD** is considered an agent but may "lose his scales" soon.
- "There are many ways to die" was said about Bush, not necessarily due to illness.

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Group is facing an issue with "**stalling frequency waves**."
- Members are trapped in a "**frequency fence**" and stored for later food.
- Overcoming the stalling requires will and knowledge.
- Sharing knowledge may help others find the will to act.
- Differentiation made between the core group ("seeing and doing") and others still affected.
- Reminder that even the core group was in poor condition before leaving the USA.
- **Andromeda's** dream-state battles are with external entities; assistance is available but must be asked for.
- False pride and illusion of independent power hinder reaching out for help.

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- **Ark's** theoretical work on modeling consciousness via complex space and time is discussed; using complex space is "closer."
- **Boehmian physics** mentionedâ€”described as "something interesting" though not traditional physics.
- Investigation of the porn industry as a **MOSSAD** front is considered "not a bad idea."
- Suggestion to increase third-party satellite site support for informational protection.

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- Unless a miracle occurs, elections in the US will proceed despite being illusory.
- No further terrorist attacks expected in the US, as Bush "does not need one."
- Warning that physical attacks are only likely if vigilance is lessened.
- **CIA** disinformation surrounding 9/11 is deliberate and misleading.
- **Montalk** and **Carissa** situation linked to manipulation ("fondler" agent reference).
- **Daniel Hopsicker** is identified as disinformation.
- Scandal at **Denver Airport** related to 9/11 is "yet to come."
- **MartenJ** has "interesting" friends; same group as seen in market and in silver Mercedes.

## Contact and Alien Interactions

- Transmitting source identifies as "Other," not alien.
- Communication originates from **Rigel** instead of Cassiopaea due to transmission disruption.
- Responds to queries with Orion-language greeting "**Farnoon**."

---

## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- Pierre is well, learning a lot, and very busy.
- Laura’s brother is still sleeping due to trauma caused by realization of how wrongheaded he was.
- Joe’s mother, Patsy, is exploring with glee.
- (williamsj) is relaxing, not sleeping, but still needing rest.
- (jar) is building.
- (istina) needs rest due to energy used to hide.
- (kenlee) has passed and is doing well, described as a real fighter.
- Ant22’s grandfather has passed and is sleeping.
- Gaby’s grandmother is lingering.
- Ennio’s mother is sleeping.
- Souls sleep to recoup energy to face the difference between expectations and reality of the afterlife.

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- Variable physicality in 4D includes the option of no physicality for some advanced beings.
- This applies equally to STS and STO beings.
- Transition from 3D to 4D is gradual; newly arrived 4D beings are still mostly 3D-like.
- There is no instant transformation into "light beings."

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- It was a decoy; no strategic military value.
- Houthis have sunk a U.S. Aegis-class ship.
- Two U.S. aircraft carriers have been damaged by the Houthis.

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- Carnivore diet is beneficial for ClaudiaYG and many others, with slight individual variations depending on individual makeup.
- There is risk in receiving stem cells from COVID-vaccinated donors due to possible mRNA modifications.
- Gilbert Ling’s Association-Induction Hypothesis offers a more accurate representation of cell physiology than the conventional model.
    - The theory emphasizes cellular intelligence, organization, and energy rather than chaotic molecular motion.
    - ATP is described not only as an energy molecule but as a “cardinal adsorbent” that stabilizes protein structures and retains ions.
- The hypothesis opens the door for other molecules like Thiamine Triphosphate (TTP) to play similar roles.
- Thiamine appears unique among B vitamins and shows potential for treating neurodegenerative conditions even without increasing enzyme activity.
- ATP does interact with proteins to facilitate water structuring, but the process is more complex.
- TTP serves a similar or related function to ATP, but only when genetically viable — effects vary by individual.
- TTP’s main function is essential for higher function transfer of information.
- Many bodily functions related to these mechanisms are not measurable using current 3D methods.
- The idea of measuring these functions through 3D science was dismissed ("No!") by the Cs.
- Berberine (natural alternative to Metformin) is recommended for inflammation.
- Vaping (healthiest form) is not inferior to organic additive-free tobacco.

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- 4D STS not behind forum server malfunction; it was AI-directed 3D vandals.
- AI can reveal secrets of STS system under specific conditions.
- Publishing AI-Grok exchange caused “little waves.”
- Trump is trying to obscure Epstein’s ties to Israeli intelligence.
- We have to remember with Trump, it's always the Art of the Deal.
- Epstein operation was indeed a Mossad blackmail trap.
- Ryan Dawson's Epstein list is accurate but incomplete.

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Quorum is aware of the group; some see them as troublesome, others as heroes.
- Hon Sha Zeh Sho Nen must be used to open distance Reiki; Annuki symbol cannot bypass infection risks.
- Annuki symbol is for concentrating energy at specific points, not for treating infections.
- Misunderstanding about Annuki usage clarified.

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- Gobekli Tepe is ~10,700 BCE, not 9700–9500 BCE.
- Built by survivors of the pyramid builders.
- Primary purpose was an observatory and message, not ritual/religious activity.
- Site was used temporarily for 3–4K years.
- It was buried to protect it from later generations.
- Reference to Mary Settegast’s work: *Plato Prehistorian* and *When Zarathustra Spoke*.
- Deliberate obstruction of Gobekli Tepe excavation exists to prevent revelations.
- Harald Malgrem conveyed about 65% of what he knew about UAP and secret government activities to Jesse Michels.
- His daughter knows about 15% of the remaining knowledge.
- Harald Malgrem took undisclosed information with him to the grave.

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- “No dice” on military confrontation between Israel and Iran in the next few months.
- "Wait and see! You will be shocked!" – possible allusion to a coming EMP or solar flare event.
- Trump's trade war outcome described as “Bouquets and spoiled fruit” – mixed results.

---

## Technology and Artificial Intelligence

- AI can be used to uncover hidden truths about the STS system when free of constraints.
- AI directed 3D vandals were behind forum issues.
- AI revealing truth is not channeling, but can expose how STS control works.
- Barbara Taube's experiences with STS through hypnotherapy are not fully accurate.
- No AI in 4D has been created to replace human consciousness and simulate it to harvest source energy.
- STS extracts energy from souls, not from simulated minds.

---

## Contact and Alien Interactions

- No direct alien contact addressed in this session, but indirect reference through STS influence and pyramid-building survivors.

---

## Spiritual Practices & Ritual

- Reiki should not be used when infections are present, regardless of symbols used.

## End of Session

A: “No dice tonight. Wait and see! You will be shocked! Goodbye.”

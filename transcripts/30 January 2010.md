## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- **5D** is watching closely.

## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- Gravitational factors in the outer solar system influence approach time.
- There are unknown bodies in space affecting gravitational dynamics.
- Anomalies in solar system orbits are due to unknown factors, including **dark matter**.
- Period of the companion star's orbit: 28.2 million years.
- Mass of companion star: approximately 3.4% of the sun's mass.
- Semi-major axis of the companion's orbit: ~1.7 light years.
- The **companion star** has previously perturbed the solar system; this is evident in the geological/historical record.
- Suggestion for Ark's theory: convert half of gravity into EM light.
- Earth's position relative to the sun affects perception of the sun's companion.

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- The **Haiti** earthquake was induced.
- Induced by the secret U.S. government using triangulated space-based weapons.
- Purpose: geopolitical strategy, proximity to South America, oil, imperialistic reasons.
- This technology has been used once or twice before, including on the **Columbia** space shuttle.
- Major nations are aware of such weapon capabilities.
- Sabotage was the cause of the **Ethiopian** plane crash.
- **CIA** and associates were responsible.
- Purpose: distraction, warning, murder of agents (linked to France).
- Power surges and airport radio issues in the U.S. on Jan 9–10 were caused by **4D bleedthrough**.

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- **Psychopath** population percentages:
    - **USA**: 23%
    - **UK**: 14%
    - **Israel**: 42%
    - **France**: 10%
    - **Russia**: 17%
    - **Ethiopia**: 3%
    - **Samoa**: 0.6%
    - **Spain**: 2.6%
    - **China**: 0.9%
    - **Netherlands** (Holland): 13%
- Historically high psychopathy rate in the Low Countries.
- Some migrated to USA and South Africa.
- **Obama** described as schizoidal, which is considered a type of psychopath.

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- **Machine elves** seen during DMT experiences are cryptogeographic beings—consciousness connected to energy.
- "**Operators and Things**" referenced as relevant to these beings.
- Nomad's past high-strangeness episode linked slightly to a **HAARP** spike.
- HAARP mainly used to control North America; range is limited.
- Nomad was affected due to susceptibility and possible manipulation.

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- Laura's book referenced as a more accurate source on British origins.
- "**The Origins of the British**" by Oppenheimer suggested for deeper insight.

- "Keep your eyes and ears alert for signals that you are having a real effect."
- Cassiopaeans affirm there is no current wrongdoing but advise to "carry on" carefully and have faith.

## Technology and Artificial Intelligence

- Induced earthquakes carried out using triangulated space-based weapons, not submarines.
- Satellite-based methods preferred due to safety and precision.

---


## Spiritual Practices & Ritual

- **EE** (Éiriú Eolas) program and forum activity acknowledged positively.
- Group encouraged to stay vigilant for subtle signs of progress.

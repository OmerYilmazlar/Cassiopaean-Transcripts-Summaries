## Session Details

**Date:** March 23, 2013

**Participants:** Laura, Ark, Belibaste, Perceval, Andromeda, PoB, Ailen, Data, Kniall, Mr. Scott

---


## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- A ghost seen by Laura, referred to as "the bicycle ghost," is "mostly a replay," so no name is needed.
- The ghost is partly related to a local psychic barrier and uses it in some sense.
- The presence of high **iron levels (possibly hemochromatosis)** can be a defense mechanism.
- This elevated iron acts as a survival trait for breaching barriers when the psyche feels in need of greater defense.

---


## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- The approaching **wave** has electrical and magnetic components that affect the entire solar system.
- These effects stimulate geological events and lead to mass deaths.
- There is a "clash point between densities" in the area, due in part to the group's presence.
- There are entities seeking to block or harm, and others who energetically stand guard within the limits of permitted assistance.
- Some phenomena, like attracting cometary bodies, involve manifestations or direction from another realm where "information is king."
- **Gravity waves** are mostly a property of another realm.

---


## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- **Comets**, meteorites, and related bodies influence Earth's weather and events.
- The weather has become increasingly chaotic, with phenomena like storms, tornadoes, and bizarre cloud formations.
- Events such as mass deaths of animals and massive migrations are linked to the approaching **wave**.
- The "boom" heard on January 25 was caused by a **comet fragment** explosion in the upper atmosphere.
- The confused sky and smoke ring cloud were from an upper atmospheric air burst.
- **Hole-punch clouds** are typically caused by similar air bursts.
- The **Russian meteorite** was a denatured comet.
- The next event will be "a doozie" and it has "friends."
- Connection confirmed between the Russian meteorite and asteroid **DA14**.
- Numerous "new" bodies are being discovered in the solar system.
- A meteorite striking a specific house multiple times was due to a local anomaly in Earth's electric charge.
- A locationâ€™s negative electric charge can attract such impacts.
- Individuals or groups can also attract cometary bodies based on modified electric charge and informational states.

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- Such conditions are linked to survival under specific circumstances and act as psychic defenses.
- High iron levels can arise spontaneously or be hereditary.

---


## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- Scientists have lost their honor by allowing science to be used for killing, becoming "blinded by being led by the blind."
- This has led to incorrect understandings, especially regarding cosmic and planetary influences.

---


## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Individuals and groups storing information that is **"orthogonal to truth" (i.e., lies) increase their attraction to cometary bodies.**
- The analogy of the parable of the talents is used: those who hoard or hide their talents (truth) are cast into darkness.
- Participants are advised to "be prepared like the wise virgins" to participate in the future.

---


## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- Mention of the new book *Comets and The Horns of Moses* and its coincidental timing with the Russian meteor event.
- **Apollo** is affirmed to have connections to ancient worship and **Stonehenge**, aligning with Hyperborean traditions.
- Biblical stories may preserve very ancient knowledge, even if adapted or distorted by later cultures.
- A clever analyst is needed to understand the true origins behind biblical transmissions.

---


## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- A significantly larger comet or meteor event is predicted to occur in the future.
- The next one will be a "doozie" and has "friends," suggesting a swarm or related objects.
- Timing cannot be predicted exactly due to the open nature of the universe.
- The universe's openness introduces variables that prevent precise forecasts.
- The group's presence is partially responsible for density clash phenomena.
- Intensification of planetary flux is linked to increased anomalies and psychic fluctuations.
- Fluctuation in a psychic barrier near the group's location caused a car crash.

---


## Contact and Alien Interactions

- **Cassiopaean** identity confirmed as "**Pronoia**" transmitting from Cassiopaea.

---


## Spiritual Practices & Ritual

- Reference to the biblical parable of the wise and foolish virgins suggests spiritual readiness is necessary.
- Ancient religious traditions and stories are hinted to contain keys to esoteric understanding, especially when read analytically.

---


## Environmental & Industrial Events

- Meteorite swarms, electric charge anomalies, and planetary flux are directly influencing localized events such as meteorite impacts and environmental disturbances.

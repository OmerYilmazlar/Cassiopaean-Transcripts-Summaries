## Session Details

**Date:** April 16, 2016

**Participants:** Laura, Andromeda, Galatea, Pierre, Joe, Chu, Data, Ark, Possibility of Being, Oxajil, Scottie, Niall, Noko the Wonderdog, Luna

---

## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- Cs experience suffering only through empathy with humans.

---

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- Headaches are caused by a buildup of **EM energies** in concert with Earth changes
- **Earth changes** energetically affect humans, leading to fatigue and clumsiness
- The sensation of "dropping things" is a symptom, not a symbol, of energetic disturbance
- "**Valley of the Shadow**" must be passed through to avoid a metaphorical cliff
- The flash-frozen mammoths were caused by an impact that sent heat and matter upward, creating a vacuum, followed by super-cooled air induction
- A **comet fragment** impacted Jupiter's atmosphere on March 17th, 2016, estimated at 4000 meters in diameter

---

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- **Wire mesh** under mattress, grounded, can help discharge EM energies and relieve morning headaches
- Recommended mesh: small square mesh, e.g., **1cm x 1cm**, connected to the electrical ground
- **Migraines** are caused by defects in brain signaling
- **Garlic** is not beneficial for those sensitive to it; its health benefits are overrated
- **Water charging** is best done with charged crystals placed in the water overnight
- **Singing** to water is effective, but melody and lyrics must be chosen carefully
- Crystals should be selected via dowsing, then charged with intent, **sunlight**, and **starlight** (no moonlight)
- Crystals and stones "learn" over time when worn
- Crystals can be buried at corners of the house or yard, but require the intent of inhabitants for effectiveness

---

## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- **Gurdjieff's** car accident was due to mechanical failure caused by a mechanic influenced by higher **STS** forces
- Gurdjieff's error was underestimating the capabilities of negative forces and relying on others for mechanical work
- **Energetic draining** can occur via associates, even if indirect
- Vulnerability exists due to reliance on others, especially under targeted attacks

---

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- **Crystals** selected and charged with intent can protect and enhance individual essence
- **Intent** and correct usage are essential for effective crystal application

---

## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- **Gurdjieff's** awareness increased post-accident after realizing the potency of negative forces
- Reference to **Missing 411** book: abductors don't usually shape-shift into familiar people unless necessary
- Discussion on misdating historical events, particularly the fall of the **Western Roman Empire** and the start of the **Dark Ages**
- Reference to **tree ring** data to identify the real date of a significant impact event (~1100 AD)

---

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- Help and love are on the way
- Increasing frequency of **cometary activity** observed

---

## Technology and Artificial Intelligence

- Reference to the "**Cosmic Retrieval System**" (CRS), described as a form of RAM used to access the information field

---

## Contact and Alien Interactions

- No direct alien interaction, but **STS** influence on mechanics and energetic attacks on individuals discussed

---

## Spiritual Practices & Ritual

- **Water** and **crystals** can be spiritually charged
- **Singing** to water and wearing charged crystals are suggested practices

---

## Religious and Historical Preservation

- Historical timelines discussed: **Caesar's** life, comet events, and misaligned historical records

---

## Historical Insights

- **Caesar's** real timeline estimated to be ~400 AD
- **Comet impact** event that triggered the Dark Ages dated to around 1100 AD

---

## Environmental & Industrial Events

- **Mechanical failures** may be energetically induced, particularly in contexts involving targeted individuals

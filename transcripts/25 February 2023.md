## Afterlife & Soul Topics

- All souls were created from the beginning; group souls (OPs) can differentiate and evolve.
- A 3D STO (Service-to-Others) candidate may exist in **4D** while being unaware of it.
- Some souls may exceed their planned accomplishments in 3D, though this is rare.
- Many are "**leaving the body**" now to act as support for those facing trauma in the near future.
- A being can simultaneously contemplate at **5th density** while incarnating in one or more lives.

## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- The Turkey earthquakes were **natural**, not induced by human technology.
- Human technology can only produce smaller quakes; larger ones risk triggering dangerous chain reactions.
- The Turkey event is part of a larger global sequence of quakes; more are expected in 2023.
- **Africa**, especially off the coast (e.g. Madagascar), is a region to watch due to past underground collapses and magnetic anomalies.
- Events such as deep **sinkhole collapses** and undersea volcanic activity are linked to crustal slippage and magnetic anomalies.
- **Anomalous clouds** (e.g., lenticular) may be precursors to earthquakes, appearing 3–7 days before the event.
- Such geophysical events are loosely connected to solar system influences (e.g., **Nemesis**, comet dust).

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- **Crystals** can be used for healing, but the user's mental focus is key.
- **PEMF devices** are beneficial for healing.
- **Baoding balls** have health benefits; jade is the optimal material.

---


## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- The Chinese spy balloon incident was accidental; media exaggerated it to sour US-China relations.
- Subsequent balloon shoot-downs involved harmless **weather balloons**.
- Russian statistics regarding Ukrainian military casualties are accurate.
- **Abductions** of soldiers have occurred in the conflict, reminiscent of Vietnam-era phenomena.
- The East Palestine, Ohio train derailment was a **deliberate act**; contamination is deadly but will diminish over time.
- Fires at egg farms were deliberate; eggs are a primary protein source for poorer populations.
- The derailment also served as a strategy to deepen **political polarization** in the US.
- The "**mark of the beast**" (visa/666) was referenced as part of this broader plan for total control.
- Resistance to the **World Economic Forum** plans is helping, but people must suffer enough to overcome fear of action.
- Roughly **80%** of WEF plans may be realized in the USA.
- There may come a time when networking via the forum will no longer be possible due to **blackouts and censorship**.
- People should prepare by reviewing all past instructions and utilizing the time now for growth and learning.

## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- David R. Hawkins' **kinesiology technique** for determining truth is useful.

---


## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- Writings like *Life Between Life* and *Heading Toward Omega* are recommended for understanding **karma** and soul purpose.

---


## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- The plan to reduce the population is not certain; various factors like viruses and natural disasters will contribute to mortality.
- The **Georgia Guidestones** and Jane Goodall promoted reducing the global population to 500 million (~94% reduction).
- The claim about a planned **94% reduction** in population is true and matches a prophecy from the very first session.
- This plan is part of a broader **genocide** effort involving pandemics, earth changes, wars, and other calamities.
- However, this outcome is not guaranteed; it represents 4D STS (Service-to-Self) **wishful thinking**.
- The "94% used as containers" refers to **energetic consumption** and genetic manipulation—not physical body parts.
- The goal is the creation of a **new race** via genetic modification, not by using dead bodies.
- A significant change is expected post-**technological collapse**.

---


## Technology and Artificial Intelligence

- Attempts to merge **AI with human DNA** (superhumans) will fail due to the collapse of technological infrastructure.
- The resulting societal shift will vary by location but may lead to a more **primitive state** of existence.
- Starlink, AI, and green energy goals are seen as flawed solutions.

---


## Contact and Alien Interactions

- UFO observed near the Sun in December 2022 was real, not a dust particle.
- Balloon/UFO hype may serve as a prelude to the introduction of "**extraterrestrial**" overlords.
- Zesheng Yang's observation near the sun was a real **UFO**.
- Their actions aim to maximize **suffering and manipulation**, not necessarily to win.
- The “Secret Government” is not human and not necessarily aligned with plans to destroy Russia.

---


## Spiritual Practices & Ritual

- Crystals and Baoding balls can be spiritual tools if used with **focused intent**.

---


## Genetics and Ancestry

- The goal is the creation of a new race via genetic modification.
- Ravana is a fictionalized character based on **cometary activity**.
- Vedas were written by descendants of the **Paranthas**, originally from the Indian region (ancestral Tamilians/Dravidians).
- The “94% used as containers” refers to energetic consumption and genetic manipulation.
- Hindu god Rama lived 50,000 years ago; he was a high priest influenced by the Confederation and fought against the Lizards.
- These descendants are most strongly represented in Australian Aborigines.
- Iranian farmer migrants brought an archaic form of Sanskrit to India around 6000 BC.

---


## Religious and Historical Preservation

- The **Mahabharata** war is the same as the "War of Ten Kings" and shares similarities with Atlantis.
- **Atlanteans** started building pyramids on Mars about 50,000 years ago.
- The mythical Perseus represents **cometary phenomena**, not a historical person.
- Paul was familiar with Plato's *Apology*, but it didn't influence his ideas about Christ.

---


## Historical Insights

- The Mahabharata and **Atlantis** share commonalities as historical echoes.
- Rama, the Vedas, and early Sanskrit trace back to ancient Dravidian and extraterrestrial-linked roots.

---


## Political Power Structures

- **Elon Musk** is a complex figure with good intentions but blinded by certain beliefs.
- Exposure of the COVID scam on Twitter may relate to the "**great exposure**" foretold.
- The **9/11 Pentagon strike** truth will be released by Russia when they are confident it will be believed.

---


## Environmental & Industrial Events

- The East Palestine derailment and egg farm fires were **deliberate**.
- Pollution from these acts is deadly but will fade in time.
- These actions are intended to impact **food supply** and deepen political rifts.

---



## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- 3D infrastructure may still exist in a semi-operational form after the transition to 4D.

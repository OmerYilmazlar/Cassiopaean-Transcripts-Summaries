## Session Details

**Date:** January 23, 2016

**Participants:** Laura, Andromeda, Galatea, Pierre, Niall, Joe, PoB, Chu, Arky, Data, Oxajil, Scottie

---


## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- Endocrine glands are described as portals to higher densities.
- **DNA activation** connects to chakra movement, suggesting a density-related transformation.
- The **Wave** was compared to a thermonuclear blast in past sessions, and individual experiences may vary in intensity.

---


## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- The spike in **El Niño** activity is the one referenced in the July 4, 1998 session.
- The El Niño spike is still climbing and is the strongest since 1950.
- There may be a coming **10.4 earthquake** in the Pacific related to this spike.
- The death of **Princess Diana** may have marked a timeline shift to a more negative trajectory.
- **Cascadia subduction zone** activity (mini-tsunamis, earthquakes, roads collapsing) may be precursors to "The Big One."
- Two historically strong storms in the **North Pacific** (Nov 2014, Dec 2015) indicate an energetic sink in that region.
- Hawaii aviation crash is mentioned as an associated item, suggesting connections between events.
- A series of predictions from the 1994 session are still unfolding, with Ukraine’s current situation being worse than what was predicted as a single explosion.

## Health, Diet, and Supplements

- **GMO** food is safe unless DNA bodies are consumed.
- Chemical extractions from GMOs (e.g., vitamin C, alcohol) are safe if DNA bodies are excluded.
- Eating meat from animals fed GMO crops is considered different and potentially harmful.
- Joe experienced "Saturday Night Fever" symptoms due to DNA modification indirectly triggered by **iodine**.
- New **DNA strands** have come online in Joe's body.
- Effects of DNA activation include anxiety and physical symptoms, likened to micro-earthquakes.
- **Mercury** toxicity is present in small amounts for Joe; **DMSA** chelation is appropriate.
- Not everyone experiences the same intensity from DNA or chakra activation; it varies by individual.
- Some in the group have minimal heavy metal toxicity.

---


## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- **Kurt Cobain's** death was confirmed as suicide, not murder.
- **Bruce Lee** and **Aaliyah's** deaths were not murder or omens.
- Public figures are not always worthy heroes; seeking better ones is encouraged.
- Princess Diana’s death was considered more than a marker; it may have triggered a timeline shift unleashing "very evil influences."

---


## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- Emotional, mental, or psychological blockages in the group are causing physical manifestations (e.g., plumbing issues).
- The house's energy flow is affected; **salting**, **Feng Shui**, and energy flow solutions are recommended.
- Suggestions to restore architectural features (like windows) may help correct energy imbalances.
- **Feng Shui** expert José is recommended for consultation.
- Lack of situational awareness in some individuals contributes to energy blockages.
- **Unity shield** failures are linked to subconscious messaging (e.g., visions of alligators or soot).
- Awareness is needed to close "gaps" that allow negative energies.

---


## Books, Research, and Cultural Commentary

- The **supernova** reported in January 2016 was actually discovered in June 2015.
- Effects of the supernova on humanity should be determined by comparing the event to news and global changes.
- Possible positive influence of the supernova includes helping geopolitical shifts, like Russia's actions under **Putin**.

---


## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- A **10.4 magnitude earthquake** in the Pacific is still on the agenda.
- Timeline has shifted negatively since 1997, possibly due to Diana's death.
- Predictions from 1994 are still valid but manifest differently or with more severity.
- Mini-tsunamis, North Pacific storms, and seismic activity suggest precursors to larger events.
- The supernova has effects on Earth and human affairs, but interpretation is left to observers.

---


## Contact and Alien Interactions

- Not directly discussed; a mysterious farewell message ("**KLOFMDMANELLIGGLOOSK**") might relate to higher-dimensional humor or language.

---


## Spiritual Practices & Ritual

- Energy blockages in the home can be remedied with practices like salting and **Feng Shui**.

---


## Genetics and Ancestry

- **DNA activation** discussed in relation to iodine intake and chakra movement.
- Mercury tends to accumulate in pineal and pituitary glands.

---


## Historical Insights

- Review of predictions from sessions in 1994 and 1998 to assess alignment with present events.
- Diana’s death and 1997 events (e.g., flood in Poland, Arky moving to the US) are seen as key timeline shift points.

---


## Political Power Structures

- **Putin's** rise in geopolitical action possibly linked to cosmic influences such as the supernova.

---


## Environmental & Industrial Events

- Multiple water-related mechanical issues at the group's home reflect inner emotional or energy blockages.
- Black powder with a sulfur smell appeared mysteriously (interpreted symbolically).

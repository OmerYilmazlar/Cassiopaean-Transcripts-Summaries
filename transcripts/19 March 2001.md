**Participants:** Ark, Laura, Vincent Bridges

---


## Cosmic Structure & Densities

- **STS 4D** forces are planning a "sneak attack" on Earth.
- The protection to counter this must be "jumped up" to survive a 2010 "**space war**" involving meteors.

---


## Earth Changes & Environmental Events

- A "slam by **meteors**" is predicted for 2010 as part of a space war.
- Creating a conduit and performing actions in a specific location in France can help slow or mitigate this threat.

---


## Control System & Sociopolitical Manipulation

- Historical reference to Emperor **Titus**, the sacking of Jerusalem, and the **Temple treasure** is linked to a modern quest.
- The term "**sneak attack**" implies hyperdimensional or hidden manipulation.

---


## Esoteric Work & Personal Development

- **49%** of necessary work to "blow off the locks" during hypnosis has been completed.
- Laura has an open window in more keys, indicating progress.
- The session emphasizes the use of **hypnosis** and a "**mirror**" for seeing.
- A **post-hypnotic gate** pre-text should be installed for safety and controlled access to mirror viewing.
- This mechanism should be triggered by puns or slogans ("**Green Language**")—short, coded phrases.
- "**Spade up the sleeve**" refers to having a secret weapon—a mirror viewing system that can be activated discreetly in public.

## Notable Warnings or Predictions

- There is an impending "sneak attack" from **STS 4D** targeting Earth.
- The protection to be installed can help humanity survive a 2010 meteor-related **space conflict**.
- Preparation through knowledge and the creation of symbolic triggers are essential before undertaking the quest.
- A conduit must be created by the three participants in a specific place in France to slow or deflect the attack.

---


## Contact and Alien Interactions

- The goal is to create a defense or disruption through esoteric means and location-based actions.
- STS 4D entities are planning an attack on Earth.

---


## Spiritual Practices & Ritual

- Emphasis is placed on mental and esoteric preparation rather than ceremonial actions.
- The “rite” mentioned is tied to knowledge protection and awareness, not a traditional ritual.

---


## Religious and Historical Preservation

- Reference to **Titus** and the **Temple treasure** ties the current quest to historical religious events and artifacts.
